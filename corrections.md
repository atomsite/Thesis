# Main Changes

> The thesis abstract needs completely rewriting to reflect work undertaken, it currently uses flowery language to describe the context and does not give the reader sufficient information about the aims, methods, and conclusions. 

> The (probably humorously meant) footnotes should be removed from the body of the thesis.

- [X] Removed the humorous footnotes, but kept the ones in the acknowledgements, and any that are actually useful

> Try to minimise the number of times unscientific terms such as staggering/incredibly/startling are used. 

- [X] Either removed outright or reworded
 
> Page 4: The importance of dust-producing WR+O binaries needs to be put in context in terms of AGB stars, SNe etc. A statement about the importance of these systems in the early universe needs to be made. These additions should include references to literature papers. 

- [X] Expanded, referenced Morgan & Edwards paper as well as the Draine 2003 review paper
 
> At many places in the thesis it is pointed out that the objects are “hard to observe”. To back this up, provide a justification and numerical example of which regions need to be observed at what resolution and compare this with existing facilities. Re-adjust text accordingly if needed.

- I do make a rudimentary argument for this on page 65, section 3.2, but I will expand on this
- Use Gravity 2 micron as a comparison? 
  - JWST up to 70mas
  - GRAVITY up to 3mas
  - Use WR140, 98a and 104 as examples, as well as closest, non-dust-producing system, see blue book
- [ ] Identified sections where this occurs
- [ ] Concrete examples
- [ ] Write a table for this under the simulation section
- [ ] Reference this throughout the thesis
 
> The introductory material needs to focus more on the formation of massive stars (as distinct from low-mass star formation). It should also include references to massive binary formation, and observational evidence for the binary fraction of massive stars. Once again it must make reference to scientific papers rather than textbooks. 
 
> The section on the attempts to use the MG code should be written to reflect the scientific challenges alone. 

> Clarify equation 2.1 

- [ ] Need to check L&C for this

> The section on line-driving theory should include more papers on Wolf-Rayet winds, and theoretical investigation of line driving in these systems, once again citing original scientific papers. 
 
> Take out 21cm line from the discussion of the warm ISM 

- [X] Done, very silly mistake
 
> Page 44: The discussion of the underlying assumptions of the BIDMAS model needs to have a much stronger justification, with reference to relevant papers that demonstrate that the assumptions are reasonable. Each assumption needs a minimum of a few sentences, preferably more for the assumption about UV shielding. 
 
> The validation tests of BIDMAS, such as the comoving gas tests described in the oral examination, and other tests that are referred to in several instances in the thesis, should be presented to reassure the reader that the method works as described. 
 
> There needs to be more detail on required resolution for remap region and binary separation resolution in order to justify the resolutions adopted.  

> Correct vertical scale of Fig. 5.4 and further 

> Page 9 correct statement re. kinetic energy 

- [ ] Fixed, replaced with GPE, another very silly mistake on my part, sorry!

> Table 2.1 10^6 K for CNO or 10^7 K? 

- [X] Corrected and cited

> Correct “stellar-mass” stars 

- [X] Corrected for thesis
- [ ] Corrected for papers

> Correct all terms relating to adsorb/adsorption and call absorb etc. 

- [X] Corrected, no uses of adsorb remain

> Check eq. 2.7 

- [ ] Rewritten section surrounding it to explain, included equations that are used in the derivation of this equation, see page 189 of L&C 1999

> P 139 – reconsider whether dust can condense in the photosphere of WC7-9 stars 

> Table 5.3  give errorbars

- [ ] Added errorbars
 
> Correct citation to Dyson 2021 (include 2nd author). 

- [X] Fixed citation, I was using a citation manager which automatically listed D.A Williams as a contributor

# Additional referencing
A non-exhaustive list of where additional referencing is needed is provided below. We implore the candidate to go over the thesis material and add references in similar places that are not explicitly noted and minimise references to text books.

> WCR is also shrouded by dense….  R (can provide reference to general review paper; Review) 
 
> P5  due to its high orbital eccentricity … R 
 
> P10 binarity stars and massive stars Review  
 
> P13 entries table R 
 
> P14 This strongly suggested R 
 
> P18 MESA  R 
 
> P23 only observed dust producing WR  R 
 
> Predicted to be rare  R 
 
> P45 statement leading to footnote  R 
 
> P48 …leads to pockets of …  R 
 
> Table 2.5  References 
 
> P49 Table 2.6 likewise 
 
> P64 MG Code – need R here 
 
> P96 grain sticking factor of 0.1  R 
 
> P124 ..this is believed to be… by whom?  R 
 
> P138 …extreme cases, .. 30%   R
