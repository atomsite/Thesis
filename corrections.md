# Corrections

Note: All changes, aside from complete removals as stated in this document are displayed in bold, red font in the second draft document. In the LaTeX markup, these are formatted with the \note{} macro, in cases where sections are completely rewritten these are signposted at the beginning and end

# Main Changes

> The thesis abstract needs completely rewriting to reflect work undertaken, it currently uses flowery language to describe the context and does not give the reader sufficient information about the aims, methods, and conclusions. 
- This has been completely rewritten, Julian thinks this looks better

> The (probably humorously meant) footnotes should be removed from the body of the thesis.
- Removed the humorous footnotes, but kept the ones in the acknowledgements, and any that are actually useful (it was not that many)

> Try to minimise the number of times unscientific terms such as staggering/incredibly/startling are used. 
- Either removed outright or reworded
 
> Page 4: The importance of dust-producing WR+O binaries needs to be put in context in terms of AGB stars, SNe etc. A statement about the importance of these systems in the early universe needs to be made. These additions should include references to literature papers. 
- Expanded, referenced Morgan & Edwards paper as well as the Draine 2003 review paper
- I have also reiterated on this in section 2.3.4
 
> At many places in the thesis it is pointed out that the objects are “hard to observe”. To back this up, provide a justification and numerical example of which regions need to be observed at what resolution and compare this with existing facilities. Re-adjust text accordingly if needed.
- As part of my rewrite of section 3.2, I have included a more concrete example using WR140 as a target system and comparisons with JWST and GRAVITY
 
> The introductory material needs to focus more on the formation of massive stars (as distinct from low-mass star formation). It should also include references to massive binary formation, and observational evidence for the binary fraction of massive stars. Once again it must make reference to scientific papers rather than textbooks.
- Rewritten section 2.1.1 completely
- I have kept one reference to Bodenheimer, however, the rest uses review papers and more contemporary research
 
> The section on the attempts to use the MG code should be written to reflect the scientific challenges alone. 
I have cleared it up to focus on the dust model and wind mapping, which were the two main scientific and technical issues, all complaints no matter how jovial have been removed.

> Clarify equation 2.1 
- Section has been rewritten

> The section on line-driving theory should include more papers on Wolf-Rayet winds, and theoretical investigation of line driving in these systems, once again citing original scientific papers.
- Line driving section has been mostly rewritten, a paragraph on WR and WC in specific stars has been included, discussion of WR stars line driving in the early universe has also been included

> Take out 21cm line from the discussion of the warm ISM 
- Done, very silly mistake
 
> Page 44: The discussion of the underlying assumptions of the BIDMAS model needs to have a much stronger justification, with reference to relevant papers that demonstrate that the assumptions are reasonable. Each assumption needs a minimum of a few sentences, preferably more for the assumption about UV shielding. 
- Rewritten sections 3.6.1 and 3.7.2
- Included a justification for all assumptions
 
> The validation tests of BIDMAS, such as the comoving gas tests described in the oral examination, and other tests that are referred to in several instances in the thesis, should be presented to reassure the reader that the method works as described. 
- I had to really dig to find some of my earlier validation tests, and couldn't find everything, but I have included a short section about the comoving gas tests, sorry I couldn't find more
- I have also bolstered my 3-D test section with a short section on grain growth

> There needs to be more detail on required resolution for remap region and binary separation resolution in order to justify the resolutions adopted.
- Rewritten paragraph in section 3.2 discussing binary separation resolution
- I have expanded on this significantly in section 3.6.2

> Correct vertical scale of Fig. 5.4 and further 
- This was the L' wavelength (3.8 rather than 38 micron) if I recall, corrected
  - Edited .tex files for figures directly for Fig 5.4 and Fig. 5.5 as they were available
  - Remade figure 2.20, made it a bit more clear as well

> Page 9 correct statement re. kinetic energy 
- Fixed, replaced with GPE, another very silly mistake on my part, sorry!

> Table 2.1 10^6 K for CNO or 10^7 K? 
- Corrected and cited

> Correct “stellar-mass” stars 
- Corrected for thesis
- Corrected for papers

> Correct all terms relating to adsorb/adsorption and call absorb etc. 
- Corrected, no uses of adsorb remain

> Check eq. 2.7 
- This section has been rewritten

> P 139 – reconsider whether dust can condense in the photosphere of WC7-9 stars 
- Mistake, rephrased and removed

> Table 5.3  give errorbars
- Added uncertainties for Thomas citations, Williams 1990 had no uncertainties, calculated values use either Williams or a mix, so cannot be calculated, these are estimations anyway
 
> Correct citation to Dyson 2021 (include 2nd author). 
- Fixed citation, something went wrong with my citation manager

# Additional referencing
A non-exhaustive list of where additional referencing is needed is provided below. We implore the candidate to go over the thesis material and add references in similar places that are not explicitly noted and minimise references to text books.

> Minimise references to textbooks
- Rewritten S2.1, which was mostly textbook based
- General reduction in textbook citation
- Book citation section has been merged with main citation section as now less than a third the length
 
> P4. We find that these binary systems …  Provide reference  (henceforth R) 
- Done, as part of rewording
> WCR is also shrouded by dense….  R (can provide reference to general review paper; Review)
- Used Crowther 2007 review paper
> P5  due to its high orbital eccentricity … R 
- Crowther 2003 
> P10 binarity stars and massive stars Review

> P138 …extreme cases, .. 30%   R 
- Fixed, Lau again

# Other Corrections
> This is a non-exhaustive list

- General proof reading and citation adding

# Corrections from Julian - 2023-01-23
> Julian sent me a list of minor corrections prior to submission, I have included some of these changes and corresponding notes

> p4 - another reason why WCR dust is relatively more important in the early universe is because there won't be a significant number of AGB stars around for 100's of millions of years. Check whether Morgan & Edmunds 2003 is a suitable reference for this too - otherwise try to reference a suitable review article.
- Noted AGB star depletion
- Morgan and Edmunds reference moved, used citations from Dwek & Cherchneff 2011 and Soulain et al. 2022 

> p13 - "orbits. However, this biases".  Also "too extreme to be". You might also want to reference a recent review article such as Motte et al. 2018, ARA&A, 56, 41.
- Fixed, general correction as well
- Added citation

> p21 - The sentence on line 2 stops half way through. Also change "yield" to "rate". Also the 6th line from the end of section 2.1.3.2 just stops.
- That was the last sentence I was working on, I must have sent you a copy of the document before recompilation

> p33 - reference is garbled.
- Fixed, key error, checked error log for similar garbled references

> p54 - it looks like you have added Fig. 2.22. Please make sure that you also refer to it in the main text.
- Indeed added, for illustrative purposes, I have referred to it in the main text now

> p77 - "below at" -> "below"
- Fixed

> Fig. 3.14 caption - "over-estimates" and "produced at these conditions".
- Fixed

> Fig. 3.18 caption - "that changing"
- Fixed

> p102 - "BIDMAS model. Another" and "WCR itself; . As" - in fact, rewrite this whole sentence beginning with "However," and "co-moving. Whilst"
- Rewrote sentence

> Fig 6.1 caption - in fact, WR140 has already been observed by JWST, as you have already shown/noted.
- Corrected, added a brief sentence to discuss this
