\section{Contemporary Dust Models}

\subsection{The Hendrix dust model}

Perhaps the most similar contemporary dust model is the model described in \cite{hendrix_pinwheels_2016} - as this model is concerned with simulating the dynamics of dust within a CWB.
This is not to say that these models are identical, of course, as the Hendrix model explores how dust spreads throughout the WCR of WR 98a, in order to compare with observational data using radiative transfer code. %//FIXME double check that one king 

% Differences between models 

To that end, the main differentiating factors between this model and our model are the driving mechanism and dust evolution.
In the Hendrix model dust is modelled as a separate fluid, with
