  abstract = {Numerical values of the radiation pressure on spectral lines are presented for the envelopes of stars having spectral type O-G and any luminosity, metallicity, or velocity structure. The line acceleration is calculated using a tabulation of atomic lines that is complete for the elements H-Zn. The acceleration is found to be remarkably constant over the temperature range 50,000-10,000 K but to drop off sharply for cooler stars. The anomalous ionization observed in OB stars decreases the acceleration by a factor of as much as 2 from radiative equilibrium values. More than half of the acceleration comes from lines whose frequencies overlap with those of neighboring lines at some point in the wind. Line blanketing of the continuum flux by the wind becomes significant for mass loss rates above 10 to the -6th solar mass/yr. The predicted and observed mass loss rates are in complete agreement for the OB stars, and it is concluded that radiation pressure is the dominant mechanism driving the winds from these stars.},

Limiting cases of the plasma diffuse field coupling are calculated, and the resulting cooling functions are presented. Some functions are terminated before reaching 10 exp 4 K when the internal photoionization halts the cooling. The functions represent a self-consistent set of curves covering a wide grid of temperature and metallicities using recently published atomic data and processes.

This two-epoch imaging provides an expansion parallax and thus a practically assumption-free geometric distance to the nebula, d = 3.35 {$\pm$} 0.67 kpc. Combined with the global velocity distribution in the ejected nebula, this confirms the extreme runaway status of WR 124.

Their structures, meaning the spatial variations of the disk physical conditions, reflect the underlying mechanisms that drive those formation processes. Observations of the solids and gas in these disks, particularly at high resolution, provide fundamental insights on their mass distributions, dynamical states, and evolutionary behaviors. Over the past decade, rapid developments in these areas have largely been driven by observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This review highlights the state of observational research on disk structures, emphasizing the following three key conclusions that reflect the main branches of the field: {$\blacksquare$} Relationships among disk structure properties are also linked to the masses, environments, and evolutionary states of their stellar hosts. {$\blacksquare$} There is clear, qualitative evidence for the growth and migration of disk solids, although the implied evolutionary timescales suggest the classical assumption of a smooth gas disk is inappropriate. {$\blacksquare$} Small-scale substructures with a variety of morphologies, locations, scales, and amplitudes\textemdash presumably tracing local gas pressure maxima\textemdash broadly influence the physical and observational properties of disks.The last point especially is reshaping the field, with the recognition that these disk substructures likely trace active sites of planetesimal growth or are the hallmarks of planetary systems at their formation epoch.},

Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the physics of potential angular momentum transport processes\textemdash including self-gravity, magnetorotational instability, baroclinic instabilities, and magnetic braking\textemdash and in developing testable models for disk dispersal via photoevaporation. The relative importance of these processes depends upon the initial mass, size, and magnetization of the disk, and subsequently on its opacity, ionization state, and external irradiation. Disk dynamics is therefore coupled to star formation, pre-main-sequence stellar evolution, and dust coagulation during the early stages of planet formation and may vary dramatically from star to star. The importance of validating theoretical models is emphasized, with the key observations being those that probe disk structure on the scales between 1 AU and 10 AU, where theory is most uncertain.},

Our analysis reveals phase-locked variations repeating consistently over many consecutive orbits, in agreement with an X-ray emission fully explained by thermal emission from the colliding winds in the 208-d orbit. We report on a significant deviation of the X-ray flux with respect to the 1/D trend (expected for adiabatic shocked winds) close to periastron passage. The absence of a drop in post-shock plasma temperature close to periastron suggests this break in trend cannot be explained in terms of reduced pre-shock velocities in this part of the orbit. Finally, NuSTAR data reveal a lack of hard X-ray emission (above 10.0 keV) above the background level. Upper limits on a putative non-thermal emission strongly suggest that the sensitivity of present hard X-ray observatories is not sufficient to detect non-thermal emission from massive binaries above 10 keV, unless the wind kinetic power is large enough to significantly feed particle acceleration in the wind-wind interaction.},

The structure varies dramatically from interconnected wrapped and defective sp2 sheets at 0.95 g/cm3 to a nearly perfect tetrahedral topology at 3.5 g/cm3. Force Enhanced Atomic Refinement (FEAR) was used and is shown here to be advantageous relative to conventional ab initio melt quench methods. We thoroughly characterize our models by computing structural, electronic and vibrational properties. The vibrational density of states of the 0.95 g/cm3 model is strikingly similar to monolayer amorphous graphene. Our sp2/sp3 ratios are close to experimental predictions where available.},

Protoplanetary disks are the environment where these dust grains need to grow at least 13 orders of magnitude in size. Our understanding of this growth process is far from complete, with different physics seemingly posing obstacles to this growth at various stages. Yet, the ubiquity of planets in our galaxy suggests that planet formation is a robust mechanism. This chapter focuses on the earliest stages of planet formation, the growth of small dust grains towards the gravitationally bound ``planetesimals'', the building blocks of planets. We will introduce some of the key physics involved in the growth processes and discuss how they are expected to shape the global behavior of the solid content of disks. We will consider possible pathways towards the formation of larger bodies and conclude by reviewing some of the recent observational advances in the field.},

Developing performance-sensitive code requires a programming language that puts programmers in control of how memory, processor time, and other system resources are used. The Rust systems programming language combines that control with a modern type system that catches broad classes of common mistakes, from memory management errors to interthread data races. With this practical guide, experienced systems programmers will learn how to successfully bridge the gap between performance and safety using Rust. Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, and Leonora Tindall demonstrate how Rust's features put programmers in control over memory consumption and processor use by combining predictable performance with memory safety and trustworthy concurrency.

  abstract = {Apep is the brightest and most luminous non-thermal colliding-wind binary by over an order of magnitude. It has been suggested from infrared observations that one of the Wolf\textendash Rayet stars in Apep is launching an anisotropic wind. Here we present radio observations of Apep from 0.2 to 20\,GHz taken over 33~yr. The spectrum reveals an extremely steep turnover in the flux density at low frequencies, where the flux density decreases by two orders of magnitude over only 325\,MHz of bandwidth. This exponential decline is best described by free\textendash free absorption, with a turnover frequency at 0.54~{$\pm$} 0.01\,GHz. Above the turnover, the spectrum is well described by a power-law and a high-frequency cut-off likely caused by inverse-Compton cooling. The light curve of Apep shows significant variation over the observing period, with Apep brightening by over 50\,mJy in a span of 25~yr at 1.4\,GHz. Models that assume spherical winds do not replicate all of the structure evident in the radio light curve. We derived a model that allows one of the winds in the system to be anisotropic. This anisotropic model recovers most of the structure of the light curve and is a significantly better statistical fit to the data than the spherical wind model. We suggest such a result is independent support that one of the Wolf\textendash Rayet stars in Apep is launching an anisotropic wind. If the anisotropic wind model is correct, we predict a {$\sim$}25~per~cent decrease of the 1.4\,GHz flux density of Apep over the next 5 yr.},

Considerable progress has been made over the past years in the physical description of the first stages of planetesimal formation, owing to extensive laboratory work. This review examines the experimental achievements and puts them into the context of the dust processes in protoplanetary disks. It has become clear that planetesimal formation starts with the growth of fractal dust aggregates, followed by compaction processes. As the dust-aggregate sizes increase, the mean collision velocity also increases, leading to the stalling of the growth and possibly to fragmentation, once the dust aggregates have reached decimeter sizes. A multitude of hypotheses for the further growth have been proposed, such as very sticky materials, secondary collision processes, enhanced growth at the snow line, or cumulative dust effects with gravitational instability. We will also critically review these ideas.},

I discuss how massive-star formation can be understood as being due to competitive accretion in stellar clusters. Massive binary systems are then formed due to accretion onto wider low-mass systems. The combination of accretion and dynamical interactions with other stars in the cluster then result in producing a close binary system. Tidal and 3-body captures in dense stellar cores can also play a role in forming massive binary systems while stellar mergers of such close binary systems due to interactions may play an important role in overcoming the radiation pressure.},

Accretion in clusters is a dynamic phenomenon as both the stars and the gas respond to the same gravitational potential. Accretion rates are highly non-uniform with stars nearer the centre of the cluster, where gas densities are higher, accreting more than others. This competitive accretion naturally results in both initial mass segregation and a spectrum of stellar masses. Accretion in gas-dominated clusters is well modelled using a tidal-lobe radius instead of the commonly used Bondi{$\pm$}Hoyle accretion radius. This works as both the stellar and gas velocities are under the influence of the same gravitational potential and are thus comparable. The low relative velocity which results means that Rtidal , RBH in these systems. In contrast, when the stars dominate the potential and are virialized, RBH , Rtidal and Bondi{$\pm$}Hoyle accretion is a better fit to the accretion rates.},

  abstract = {Competitive accretion, a process to explain the origin of the initial mass function (IMF), occurs when stars in a common gravitational potential accrete from a distributed gaseous component. Stars located near the centre of the potential benefit from the gravitational attraction of the full potential and accrete at much higher rates than do isolated stars. We show that concerns recently raised on the efficiency of competitive accretion are incorrect as they use globally averaged properties which are inappropriate for the detailed physics of a forming stellar cluster. A full treatment requires a realistic treatment of the cluster potential, the distribution of turbulent velocities and gas densities. Accreting gas does not travel at the global virial velocity of the system due to the velocity\textendash sizescale relation inherent in turbulent gas and due to the lower velocity dispersion of small-N clusters in which much of the accretion occurs. Accretion occurs due to the effect of the local potential in funnelling gas down to the centre. Stars located in the gas-rich centres of such systems initially accrete from low relative velocity gas attaining larger masses before needing to accrete the higher velocity gas. Stars not in the centres of such potentials, or that enter the cluster later when the velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete significantly and thus retain their low masses. In competitive accretion, most stars do not continue to accrete significantly such that their masses are set from the fragmentation process. It is the few stars which continue to accrete that become higher-mass stars. Competitive accretion is therefore likely to be responsible for the formation of higher-mass stars and can explain the mass distribution, mass segregation and binary frequency of these stars. Global kinematics of competitive accretion models include large-scale mass infall, with mean inflow velocities of the order of {$\approx$}0.5 km s-1 at scales of 0.5 pc, but infalling signatures are likely to be confused by the large tangential velocities and the velocity dispersion present. Finally, we discuss potential limitations of competitive accretion and conclude that competitive accretion is currently the most likely model for the origin of the high-mass end of the IMF.},

In particular, the response of the model to periodic driving at its inner boundary was examined for a considerable range of stellar parameters for both fundamental and overtone modes, various driving amplitudes, and various assumptions about the physical processes involved; radiation pressure on dust and time-dependent temperature relaxation were included. Stable steady state models with periodic shocks were obtained in all cases. Both shocks and dust were found to be essential for rapid mass loss. The shocks increase the density and thus greatly increase the amount of dust formed in the cool outer atmosphere. Radiation pressure accelerates the grains, which drive a slow cool wind. Calculated mass-loss rates appear to be of the right order of magnitude to agree with observations and show how mass loss can be expected to depend on the stellar parameters.},

  abstract = {The large number of subordinate lines of a representative ion are found to have a dominant effect on the force of radiation on material in O star atmospheres. The force is increased over that due to resonance lines alone so that rates of mass loss are obtained which are 100 times greater than previously thought possible. The force is related to the solution of the line-transfer problem, and it becomes a function of the local velocity gradient. A new stellar wind theory, with a different interpretation of the singular point, is developed to treat this situation. The rate of mass loss, and other properties of the model, are uniquely specified by the luminosity, mass, and radius of the star. Alternative static models do not exist. Numerical results give a rate of mass loss 6 x 10``6 221\textcopyright{} per year for an 05 star, with a terminal velocity of 1500 km s``1. The rate of mass loss is sensitive to stellar parameters, while the terminal velocity is not. The continuum optical depth in the expanding envelope is about 0.16, of the right order to explain the reduced brightness temperature observed in \textsterling{} Pup. There is sufficient mass in the envelope for recombination to produce the emission lines of H and of He n which are observed, with approximately the proper strength. The rate of mass loss corresponds to a loss of more than 25 percent of the star's mass during main-sequence hydrogen burning, with obvious consequences for stellar evolution, and with the possibility of modified surface abundances.},

We consider only WC stars which produce dust on a continuous basis and develop for the first time non-equilibrium, chemical kinetic routes to nucleating dust precursors in the outflow. These can be used to calculate quantitatively the yield of such dust precursors for various outflow scenarios. Because WC stars have lost all their hydrogen in the WN phase, the chemical processes used in the model involve a pure helium, carbon, oxygen, silicon and sulphur chemistry which resembles that encountered in graphite or metal vaporization experiments in the laboratory. We derive abundances for small linear carbon clusters up to C\_6 and silicon-bearing species for various wind parameters and conclude that high-density regions in the form of clumps or discs are of paramount importance to the formation of dust in WC stars.

The influence of the 'inverse greenhouse' effect experienced by small PAHs is investigated and shown to increase the PAH yield by many orders of magnitude. It is shown that the route through propargyl radicals could be an important channel to produce benzene. PAH formation yields are found to be extremely sensitive to gas density and temperature and are much smaller than values inferred from the observed dust content of late-type carbon-rich stellar envelopes.

  abstract = {We have undertaken a statistical study of the component mass ratios and the orbital eccentricities of WR + O close binary, detached main-sequence (DMS), contact early-type (CE), and semidetached (SD) systems. A comparison of the characteristics of WR + O systems and of DMS, CE, and SD systems has enabled us to draw certain conclusions about the evolutionary paths of WR + O binaries and to demonstrate that up to 90\% of all known WR + O binaries formed as a result of mass transfer in massive close O + O binary systems. Since there is a clear correlation between the component masses in SD systems with subgiants, the absence of an anticorrelation between the masses of the WR stars and O stars in WR + O binaries cannot be considered evidence against the formation of WR + O binaries via mass transfer. The spectroscopic transitional orbital period Ptrspcorresponding to the transition from nearly circular orbits (esp{$<$}0.1) to elliptical orbits (esp{$\geq$}0.1) is {$\sim$}14d for WR + O systems and {$\sim$}2d\textendash 3d for OB + OB systems. The period range in which all WR + O orbits are circular \$\$(1\textbackslash mathop d\textbackslash limits\_. 6 \textbackslash leqslant P \textbackslash leqslant 14\^d )\$\$is close to the range for SD systems with subgiants, \$\$0\textbackslash mathop d\textbackslash limits\_. 7 \textbackslash leqslant P \textbackslash leqslant 15\^d \$\$. The large difference between the Ptrspvalues for WR + O and OB + OB systems suggests that a mechanism of orbit circularization additional to that for OB + OB systems at the DMS stage (tidal dissipation of the orbital energy due to radiative damping of the dynamical tides) acts in WR + O binaries. It is natural to suggest mass transfer in the parent O + O binaries as this supplementary orbit-circularization mechanism. Since the transitional period between circular and elliptical orbits for close binaries with convective envelopes and ages of 5\texttimes 109 years is \$\$P\_\{tr\}  = 12\textbackslash mathop d\textbackslash limits\_. 4\$\$, the orbits of most known SD systems with subgiants had enough time to circularize during the DMS stage, prior to the mass transfer. Thus, for most SD systems, mass transfer plays a secondary role in circularization of their orbits.},

This absorption feature is not detected in the diffuse interstellar medium toward the WR 147, Cyg OB2 No. 12, or the Pistol Star, and therefore we suggest that it is circumstellar in nature. In addition, we detect a broad absorption feature extending from approximately 6.5 to 8 mm. We tentatively attribute this absorption to the C i C stretching modes that accompany the 6.2 mm band in aromatic materials.

  abstract = {The formation of stars above about 20 M{$\odot$} and their apparently high multiplicity remain heavily debated subjects in astrophysics. We have performed a vast high-resolution radial velocity spectroscopic survey of about 250 O- and 540 B-type stars in the southern Milky Way which indicates that the majority of stars ({$>$}82 per cent) with masses above 16 M{$\odot$} form close binary systems while this fraction rapidly drops to 20 per cent for stars of 3 M{$\odot$}. The binary fractions of O-type stars among different environment classes are: clusters (72 {$\pm$} 13 per cent), associations (73 {$\pm$} 8 per cent), field (43 {$\pm$} 13 per cent) and runaways (69 {$\pm$} 11 per cent). The high frequency of close pairs with components of similar mass argues in favour of a multiplicity originating from the formation process rather than from a tidal capture in a dense cluster. The high binary frequency of runaway O stars that we found in our survey (69 per cent compared to 19-26 per cent in previous surveys) points to the importance of ejection from young star clusters and thus supports the competitive accretion scenario.},

It is concluded that coagulation can have a dramatic effect on the visible and, particularly, the UV portion of the extinction curve in dense clouds and on their IR spectrum.},

  abstract = {Calculating surface topography in geodynamic models is a common numerical problem. Besides other approaches, the so-called `sticky air' approach has gained interest as a free-surface proxy at the top boundary. The often used free slip condition is thereby vertically extended by introducing a low density, low viscosity fluid layer. This allows the air/crust interface to behave in a similar manner to a true free surface. We present here a theoretical analysis that provides the physical conditions under which the sticky air approach is a valid approximation of a true free surface. Two cases are evaluated that characterize the evolution of topography on different timescales: (1) isostatic relaxation of a cosine perturbation and (2) topography changes above a rising plume. We quantitatively compare topographies calculated by six different numerical codes (using finite difference and finite element techniques) using three different topography calculation methods: (i) direct calculation of topography from normal stress, (ii) body-fitting methods allowing for meshing the topography and (iii) Lagrangian tracking of the topography on an Eulerian grid. It is found that the sticky air approach works well as long as the term ({$\eta$}st/{$\eta$}ch)/(hst/L)3 is sufficiently small, where {$\eta$}st and hst are the viscosity and thickness of the sticky air layer, and {$\eta$}ch and L are the characteristic viscosity and length scale of the model, respectively. Spurious lateral fluctuations of topography, as observed in some marker-based sticky air approaches, may effectively be damped by an anisotropic distribution of markers with a higher number of markers per element in the vertical than in the horizontal direction.},

Recently, model atmosphere studies have advanced sufficiently to enable the determination of stellar temperatures, luminosities, abundances, ionizing fluxes, and wind properties. The observed distributions of nitrogen- (WN) and carbon (WC)-sequence WR stars in the Milky Way and in nearby star-forming galaxies are discussed; these imply lower limits to progenitor masses of {$\sim$}25, 40, and 75 M for hydrogen-depleted (He-burning) WN, WC, and H-rich (Hburning) WN stars, respectively. WR stars in massive star binaries permit studies of wind-wind interactions and dust formation in WC systems. They also show that WR stars have typical masses of 10\textendash 25 M , extending up to 80 M for H-rich WN stars. Theoretical and observational evidence that WR winds depend on metallicity is presented, with implications for evolutionary models, ionizing fluxes, and the role of WR stars within the context of core-collapse supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray bursts.},

  abstract = {We present a quantitative classification scheme for carbon and oxygen sequence Wolf-Rayet stars. Our scheme uses new high-quality optical AAT and INT observations of 20 stars for which we provide narrow-band photometry and estimates of interstellar reddenings. In increasing order of excitation, our spectral classes range from WC11 to WC4 for Wolf-Rayet stars with a dominant carbon line visual spectrum, and subsequently from WO4 to WO1 for those with predominantly oxygen lines. We refine existing WC and WO schemes to incorporate stars with higher and lower excitation spectral features. Both massive stars and central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) can be classified with the unified system. We have found no criterion that cleanly separates spectra of the two types of star, including elemental abundances (C/O or C/He). However, CSPNe show a wider range of line strength and width than massive stars in the same ionization subclass. Systematically lower FWHM(Civ lambda5808) values are observed from WO-type CSPNe than from massive WO stars. For WC4-11 stars, our primary diagnostic is the equivalent width or line flux ratio Civ lambdalambda5801-12/Ciiilambda5696. We extend the use of this as the principal criterion throughout the WC sequence, with few reclassifications necessary relative to Smith, Shara \& Moffat. For WO stars, Ciii is absent and our new criteria, using primarily oxygen lines, take over smoothly. We define subclasses WO4-1, using Ovi lambdalambda3811-34/Ov lambda5590 as our primary diagnostic. The continuation in spectral sequence from WC to WO is used to indicate that the sequence is a result primarily of excitation effects, rather than significant abundance differences. Our scheme allows us to confirm that massive stars and CSPNe are differently distributed over the subclasses. Around 3/5 of massive WC stars lie within the range WC5-8, while {$<$}=1/5 of CSPNe are found within these spectral types. Stars within both the highest (WO1) and lowest (WC10-11) excitation spectral classes are unique to CSPNe. A WC classification for the hot RCrB star V348 Sgr is excluded (previously [WC12]) since both Ciii lambda5696 and Civ lambda5808 are absent in its optical spectrum. Additional criteria allow us to distinguish between WC-type, `weak emission line' CSPNe, and O stars, allowing us to reclassify the central star of IRAS 21282+5050 (previously [WC11]) as an O star.},

The dynamical effects of the winds are very modest. However, in the lower mass clouds, they influence the morphologies of the H II regions by creating 10-pc-scale central cavities. The inhomogeneous structures of the model giant molecular clouds (GMCs) make them highly permeable to photons, ionized gas and supernova ejecta, and the leaking of ionized gas in particular strongly affects their evolution, reducing the effectiveness of feedback. Nevertheless, feedback is able to expel large fractions of the mass of the lower escape velocity clouds. Its impact on star formation is more modest, decreasing final star formation efficiencies by 10\textendash 20 per cent, and the rate of change of the star formation efficiency per freefall time by about one third. However, the clouds still form stars substantially faster than observed GMCs.},

  abstract = {We study the chemical evolution of interstellar grain mantle by varying the physical parameters of the interstellar medium (ISM). To mimic the exact interstellar condition, gas grain interactions via accretion from the gas phase and desorption (thermal evaporation and photo-evaporation) from the grain surface are considered. We find that the chemical composition of the interstellar grain mantle is highly dependent on the physical parameters associated with a molecular cloud. Interstellar photons are seen to play an important role towards the growth and the structure of the interstellar grain mantle. We consider the effects of interstellar photons (photo-dissociation and photo-evaporation) in our simulation under various interstellar conditions. We notice that the effects of interstellar photons dominate around the region of lower visual extinction. These photons contribute significantly in the formation of the grain mantle. Energy of the incoming photon is attenuated by the absorption and scattering by the interstellar dust. Top most layers are mainly assumed to be affected by the incoming radiation. We have studied the effects of photo-dissociation by varying the number of layers which could be affected by it. Model calculations are carried out for the static (extinction parameter is changing with the density of the cloud) as well as the time dependent case (i.e., extinction parameter and number density of the cloud both are changing with time) and the results are discussed in details. Different routes to the formation of water molecules are studied and it is noticed that around the dense region, production of water molecules via O3 and H2O2 contributes significantly. At the end, various observational evidences for the condensed phase species are summarized with their physical conditions and are compared with our simulation results.},

Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and other modern instruments have solved a few of the mysteries concerning this object while opening a comparable number of new ones. In this review we first recount some essential background information concerning Eta, then we sketch most of the observational developments of the past few years, related to the star itself and to its ejecta.

  abstract = {Hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs with metal lines, so-called DAZs, show evidence for ongoing accretion of material onto their surfaces. Some DAZs are known to have unresolved M dwarf companions, which could account for the observed accretion through a stellar wind. I combine observed Ca abundances of the DAZs with information on the orbital separation of their M dwarf companions to infer the mass-loss rate of the M dwarfs. I find that for three of the six known DAZs with M dwarf companions, a stellar wind can plausibly explain the observed accretion on the white dwarfs assuming Bondi-Hoyle accretion of solar abundance stellar winds on the order of 10-14 to 10-16 M{$\Sun$} yr-1. The rest of the sample have companions with orbits {$\greaterequivlnt$}1 AU and require companion mass-loss rates of {$>$}10-11 M{$\Sun$} yr-1. I conclude that there must be an alternative explanation for accretion of material onto DAZs with widely separated companions. The inferred winds for two of the close binaries are orders of magnitude smaller than typically assumed for the angular momentum loss of red dwarf-white dwarf pairs due to magnetic braking from a stellar wind and may seriously affect predictions for the formation rate of CVs with low-mass companions.},

In particular, hydrogen and oxygen abundances, that could provide a way of discriminating between different evolutionary channels, are affected by large uncertainties. Following the ground-breaking discovery that cool [WC] central stars harbor hot carbon- as well as hot oxygen-rich dust, current theories of their origin have been put in serious doubt. Observations of three cool [WC] central stars are presented here which, while confirming the deficiency of our theoretical understanding, hint at the possibility of alternative scenarios, such as dust-storing disks.},

  abstract = {We present calculations of the spatial and spectral distribution of the radio emission from a wide WR+OB collidingwind binary system based on high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations and solutions to the radiative transfer equation. We account for both thermal and synchrotron radio emission, free-free absorption in both the unshocked stellar wind envelopes and the shocked gas, synchrotron self-absorption, and the Razin effect. To calculate the synchrotron emission several simplifying assumptions are adopted: the relativistic particle energy density is a simple fraction of the thermal particle energy density, in equipartition with the magnetic energy density, and a power-law in energy. We also assume that the magnetic field is tangled such that the resulting emission is isotropic. The applicability of these calculations to modelling radio images and spectra of colliding-wind systems is demonstrated with models of the radio emission from the wide WR+OB binary WR 147. Its synchrotron spectrum follows a power-law between 5 and 15 GHz but turns down to below this at lower and higher frequencies. We find that while free-free opacity from the circum-binary stellar winds can potentially account for the low-frequency turnover, models that also include a combination of synchrotron self-absorption and Razin effect are favoured. We argue that the highfrequency turn down is a consequence of inverse-Compton cooling. We present our resulting spectra and intensity distributions, along with simulated MERLIN observations of these intensity distributions. From these we argue that the inclination of the WR 147 system to the plane of the sky is low. We summarise by considering extensions of the current model that are important for models of the emission from closer colliding wind binaries, in particular the dramatically varying radio emission of WR 140.},

Destruction rates for grains are estimated as a function of size, composition, and type of region in which the grains are located, and the relative importance of the different mechanisms is evaluated. Grain destruction behind steady-state shock waves is examined, grain motion and sputtering in the cooling postshock gas is analyzed, and numerical results for the fractional grain mass sputtered are given for various preshock conditions, grain types and sizes, and shock speeds of 10 to 350 km/s. Grain sputtering in spherically symmetric supernova remnants is investigated as a function of supernova energy and ambient density. The results are applied to consider the destruction of grains (1) in collisions between randomly moving interstellar clouds; (2) in supernovae in a 'one-phase', a 'two-phase', and a 'three-phase' ISM; (3) by sputtering in H II regions; (4) by cosmic-ray sputtering; (5) by UV photodesorption; and (6) by sublimation of volatile mantles from grains heated in H II regions or by supernova radiation.},

Sputtering rates are estimated for grains in hot gas, based upon a semiempirical fit to experimental data. Predicted sputtering rates for possible grain constituents are similar to estimates by Barlow (1978), but in some cases differ significantly.

  abstract = {Methods. We obtained high-resolution spectra of the complete magnitude-limited sample of 11 Galactic WNL stars with the Mercator telescope on the island of La Palma. We used cross-correlation with a log-likelihood framework to measure relative RVs and flagged binary candidates based on the peak-to-peak RV dispersion. By using Monte Carlo sampling and a Bayesian framework, we computed the three-dimensional likelihood and one-dimensional posteriors for the upper period cut-off (log PWmaNxL), power-law index ({$\pi$}WNL), and intrinsic binary fraction ( fiWntNL). Results. Adopting a threshold C of 50 km s-1, we derived foWbsNL = 0.36 {$\pm$} 0.15. Our Bayesian analysis produces fiWntNL = 0.42+-00..1157, {$\pi$}WNL = -0.70+-01..7032 and log PWmaNxL = 4.90+-03..0490 for the parent WNL population. The combined analysis of the Galactic WN population results in fiWntN = 0.52+-00..1142, {$\pi$}WN = -0.99+-00..5570 and log PWmaNx = 4.99+-01..0101. The observed period distribution of Galactic WN and WC binaries from the literature is in agreement with what is found. Conclusions. The period distribution of Galactic WN binaries peaks at P{$\sim$}1-10 d and that of the WC population at P{$\sim$}5000 d. This shift cannot be reconciled by orbital evolution due to mass loss or mass transfer. At long periods, the evolutionary sequence O (\textrightarrow - LBV)\textrightarrow - WN\textrightarrow - WC seems feasible. The high frequency of short-period WN binaries compared to WC binaries suggests that they either tend to merge, or that the WN components in these binaries rarely evolve into WC stars in the Galaxy.},

  abstract = {Methods. We obtained high-resolution spectroscopic time series of the complete magnitude-limited sample of 16 WNE stars observable with the 1.2 m Mercator telescope at La Palma, typically providing a time base of about two to eight years. We measured relative radial velocities (RVs) using cross-correlation and used RV variations to flag binary candidates. Using an updated Monte Carlo method with a Bayesian framework, we calculated the three-dimensional likelihood for the intrinsic binary fraction ( fiWntNE), the maximum period (log Pmax), and the power-law index for the period distribution ({$\pi$}) for the WNE population with Pmin fixed at 1 d. We also used this updated method to re-derive multiplicity parameters for the Galactic WC population. Results. Adopting a peak-to-peak RV variability threshold of 50 km s-1 as a criterion, we classify 7 of the 16 targets as binaries. This results in an observed multiplicity fraction ( foWbsNE) of 0.44 {$\pm$} 0.12. Assuming flat priors, we derive the best-fit multiplicity properties fiWntNE = 0.56+-00..2105, log Pmax = 4.60+-00..4707, and {$\pi$} = -0.30+-00..5553 for the parent WNE population. We explored different mass-ratio distributions and note that they did not change our results significantly. For the Galactic WC population from Paper I, we re-derive fiWntC = 0.96+-00..0242, log Pmin = 0.75+-00..2660, log Pmax = 4.00+-00..4324, and {$\pi$} = 1.90-+11..2256. Conclusions. The derived multiplicity parameters for the WNE population are quite similar to those derived for main-sequence O binaries but differ from those of the WC population. The significant shift in the WC period distribution towards longer periods is too large to be explained via expansion of the orbit due to stellar winds, and we discuss possible implications of our results. Analysis of the WNL population and further investigation of various evolutionary scenarios is required to connect the different evolutionary phases of stars at the upper-mass end.},

  abstract = {Stellar multiplicity is a ubiquitous outcome of the star-formation process. The frequency and main characteristics of multiple systems, and their dependence on primary mass and environment, are powerful tools to probe this process. Although early attempts were fraught with selection biases and limited completeness, instrumentation breakthroughs in the past two decades now enable robust statistical analyses. In this review, we summarize current empirical knowledge of stellar multiplicity for main sequence stars and brown dwarfs, as well as among populations of pre-main-sequence stars and embedded protostars. Among field objects, the multiplicity rate and breadth of the orbital period distribution are steep functions of the primary mass, whereas the mass ratio distribution is essentially flat for most populations other than the lowest mass objects. The time-variation of the frequency of visual companions follows two parallel, constant tracks corresponding to loose and dense stellar populations, although current observations do not yet distinguish whether initial multiplicity properties are universal or dependent on the physical conditions of the parent cloud. Nonetheless, these quantitative trends provide a rich comparison basis for numerical and analytical models of star formation.},

  abstract = {To understand how planetary systems form in the dusty disks around premain-sequence stars, a detailed knowledge of the structure and evolution of these disks is required. Although this is reasonably well understood for the regions of the disk beyond about 1 AU, the structure of these disks inward of 1 AU remains a puzzle. This is partly because it is very difficult to spatially resolve these regions with current telescopes. But it is also because the physics of this region, where the disk becomes so hot that the dust starts to evaporate, is poorly understood. With infrared interferometry it has become possible in recent years to directly spatially resolve the inner 1 AU of protoplanetary disks, albeit in a somewhat limited way. These observations have partly confirmed current models of these regions, but also posed new questions and puzzles. Moreover, it has turned out that the numerical modeling of these regions is extremely challenging. In this review, we give a rough overview of the history and recent developments in this exciting field of astrophysics.},

  abstract = {We model the dynamics, the destruction by sputtering, and the infrared (IR) emission from collisionally heated dust grains in fast ({$\geq$} 400 km s-1) astrophysical shocks in order to develop IR diagnostics for the destruction of grains in these environments. The calculations take into account the feedback from sputtering and IR emission on the gas-phase abundances, the cooling, and the ionization and thermal structure of the shock. Sputtering changes the initial grain size distribution, creating a deficiency of small (radius {$<$}50 \AA ) grains compared to their preshock abundances. The altered grain size distribution depends on shock velocity and the density of the interstellar medium. Dust particles with sizes below {$\asymp$}300 \AA{} are stochastically heated, undergo temperature fluctuations, and radiate an excess of near-infrared emission ({$\lambda$} {$\leq$} 40 {$\mu$}m) over that expected for grains in thermal equilibrium. This near-infrared excess is a measure of the abundance of small grains and therefore a powerful diagnostic for the amount of destruction the grains were subjected to in the shock. We present here IR spectra from collisionally heated dust for a variety of shocks, and depict the changes in the spectra as a function of postshock column density. Our studies compliment those of Vancura et al. that examined the effects of the release of the sputtered refractory elements on the ultraviolet and X-ray emission. Multiwavelength observations at X-ray, UV, and IR wavelengths are therefore essential in piecing together a comprehensive picture of the physics of grain destruction in fast astrophysical shocks.},

The first assumes that this galaxy is much younger than the age of the universe at that epoch so that only supernovae (SNe) could have produced this dust. The second scenario assumes a significantly older galactic age, so that the dust could have formed in lower-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Presenting new integral solutions for the chemical evolution of metals and dust in galaxies, we offer a critical evaluation of these two scenarios and observational consequences that can discriminate between the two. We show that AGB stars can produce the inferred mass of dust in this object, however, the final mass of surviving dust depends on the galaxy's star formation history (SFH). In general, SNe cannot produce the observed amount of dust unless the average SN event creates over \textasciitilde 2 M sun of dust in its ejecta. However, special SFHs can be constructed in which SNe can produce the inferred dust mass with a reasonable average dust yield of \textasciitilde 0.15 M sun. The two scenarios propose different origins for the galaxy's spectral energy distribution, different star formation efficiencies and stellar masses, and consequently different comoving number densities of J1148+5251-type hyperluminous infrared (IR) objects. The detection of diagnostic mid-IR fine structure lines and more complete surveys determining the comoving number density of these objects can discriminate between the two scenarios.},

  abstract = {Dust production is one of the more curious phenomena observed in massive binary systems with interacting winds. The high temperatures, UV photon flux, and violent shocks should destroy any dust grains that condense. However, in some extreme cases, dust production yields of approximately 30~per\,cent of the total mass-loss rate of the stellar winds have been observed. In order to better understand this phenomenon, a parameter space exploration was performed using a series of numerical models of dust producing carbon phase Wolf\textendash Rayet (WCd) systems. These models incorporated a passive scalar dust model simulating dust growth, destruction, and radiative cooling. We find that reasonable dust yields were produced by these simulations. Significant changes in the dust yield were caused by changing the mass-loss rates of the stars, with a greater mass-loss rate contributing to increased dust yields. Similarly, a close orbit between the stars also resulted in higher dust yields. Finally, a high-velocity wind shear, which induces Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz (KH) instabilities and wind mixing, drastically increases the dust yields.},

  abstract = {The wind collision region (WCR) in a colliding wind binary (CWB) is a particularly violent place, as such, it is surprising that it is also a region where significant quantities of interstellar dust can form. In extreme cases, approximately 30~per\,cent of the total mass-loss rate of a system can be converted into dust. These regions are poorly understood, as observation and simulation of these systems are difficult. In our previous paper, we simulated dust growth in CWB systems using an advected scalar model and found our model to be suitable for qualitative study. For this paper, we simulated the periodic dust forming CWB (WCd) system WR140 with our dust model, to determine how dust growth changes over the systems periastron passage. We found that dust production increases significantly at periastron passage, which is consistent with IR emission of the surrounding dusty shell. We also find that the dust production rate of the system decreases rapidly as the stars recede from each other, though the rate of decrease is significantly lower than the rate of increase during periastron passage. This was found to be due to strong cooling and its associated thermal instabilities, resulting in cool, high-density pockets of gas in the WCR where dust forms. The WCR also shows a degree of hysteresis, resulting in a radiative post-shock flow even when the stars are separated enough for the region to behave adiabatically.},

Nonthermal radio emission may be observed only if the orbital period of the binary is more than some critical value. For a typical Wolf-Rayet binary the value of the critical period is of the order of a month when the frequency of observation is a few GHz. Observations of nonthermal radio emission of the remarkable Wolf-Rayet binary WR 140, such as luminosity, spectrum, time variability in the process of orbital motion, the size of nonthermal radio source, etc., are explained by a model in which its nonthermal radio emission is generated at the site of stellar wind collision. Considerations of shock acceleration theory suggest that the WR 140 system may be a strong source of gamma-rays. It is proposed that EGRET could both measure the time dependence of the gamma-ray emission as well as resolve an inverse Compton spectrum from a pion decay spectrum and thereby provide information on the electron versus proton content of the relativistic particles.},

We investigate one population of black hole candidate binaries highlighted in the data release: sources near the main sequence in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) with dynamically-inferred companion masses \$M\_2\$ larger than the CMD-inferred mass of the luminous star. We model light curves, spectral energy distributions, and archival spectra of the 14 such objects in DR3 with high-significance orbital solutions and inferred \$M\_2 {$>$} 3\textbackslash,M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. We find that 100\textbackslash\% of these sources are mass-transfer binaries containing a highly stripped lower giant donor (\$0.2 \textbackslash lesssim M/M\_\{\textbackslash odot\} \textbackslash lesssim 0.4\$) and much more massive (\$2 \textbackslash lesssim M/M\_\{\textbackslash odot\} \textbackslash lesssim 2.5\$) main-sequence accretor. The Gaia orbital solutions are for the donors, which contribute about half the light in the Gaia RVS bandpass but only \$\textbackslash lesssim 20\textbackslash\%\$ in the \$g-\$band. The accretors' broad spectral features likely prevented the sources from being classified as double-lined. The donors are all close to Roche lobe-filling (\$R/R\_\{\textbackslash rm Roche\textbackslash,lobe\}{$>$}0.8\$), but modeling suggests that a majority are detached (\$R/R\_\{\textbackslash rm Roche\textbackslash,lobe\}{$<$}1\$). Binary evolution models predict that these systems will soon become detached helium white dwarf + main sequence "EL CVn" binaries. Our investigation highlights both the power of Gaia data for selecting interesting sub-populations of binaries and the ways in which binary evolution can bamboozle standard CMD-based stellar mass estimates.},

We present binary evolution models that fit these observational constraints. Stars in binaries with initial masses {$\lessequivlnt$} 20\,M{$\odot$} lose their hydrogen envelopes in binary interactions to become low-mass helium stars.

  abstract = {{$\blacksquare$} Abstract\hspace{0.6em} The physical conditions in molecular clouds control the nature and rate of star formation, with consequences for planet formation and galaxy evolution. The focus of this review is on the conditions that characterize regions of star formation in our Galaxy. A review of the tools and tracers for probing physical conditions includes summaries of generally applicable results. Further discussion distinguishes between the formation of low-mass stars in relative isolation and formation in a clustered environment. Evolutionary scenarios and theoretical predictions are more developed for isolated star formation, and observational tests are beginning to interact strongly with the theory. Observers have identified dense cores collapsing to form individual stars or binaries, and analysis of some of these cores support theoretical models of collapse. Stars of both low and high mass form in clustered environments, but massive stars form almost exclusively in clusters. The theoretical understanding of such regions is considerably less developed, but observations are providing the ground rules within which theory must operate. The richest and most massive star clusters form in massive, dense, turbulent cores, which provide models for star formation in other galaxies.},

Here, Mario Vietri approaches the basics of high-energy astrophysics with an emphasis on underlying physical processes as opposed to a more~mathematical approach. Alongside more traditional topics, Vietri presents new subjects increasingly considered crucial to understanding high-energy astrophysical sources, including the electrodynamics of cosmic sources, new developments in the theory of standard accretion disks,~and the physics of coronae, thick disks, and accretion onto magnetized objects. The most thorough and engaging survey of high-energy astrophysics available today, Foundations of High-Energy Astrophysics introduces the main physical processes relevant to the field in a rigorous yet accessible way, while paying careful attention to observational issues. Vietri's book will quickly become a classic text for students and active researchers in astronomy and astrophysics. Those in adjoining fields will also~find it a valuable addition to their personal libraries.},

The addition of the finite disk factor reduces the line force near the star and increases it far from the star, which lowers the mass-loss rate, increases the terminal velocity, and makes the velocity law more gradual. These changes bring the wind model into much closer agreement with observations of hot star winds. In particular, the decrease in the ratio of terminal velocity to escape velocity in the B sugergiants can now be explained as due to a change in the mixture of driving lines. Including a centrifugal force (in the equatorial plane) decreases the terminal velocity and increases the massloss rate, but neither effect is measurable in current data.},

The high-resolution observations were obtained using the Very Large Telescope's MIDI and VISIR instruments, producing visibilities in the N-band and near-diffraction-limited imaging in the Q-band respectively. By fitting simulated observables, derived from the radiative transfer model, to our observations the properties of the MYSO are constrained. Results. The VISIR image shows elongation at 100 mas scales and also displays a degree of asymmetry. From the simulated observables derived from the radiative transfer model output we find that a central protostar with a luminosity of {$\sim$}5 \texttimes{} 104 L surrounded by a low-density bipolar cavity, a flared 1 M disk and an envelope is sufficient to fit all three types of observational data for G305.20+0.21. The weak silicate absorption feature within the SED requires low-density envelope cavities to be successfully fit and is an atypical characteristic in comparison to previously studied MYSOs. Conclusions. The fact that the presence of a dusty disk provides the best fit to the MIDI visibilities implies that this MYSO is following a scaled-up version of the low-mass star formation process. The low density, low extinction environment implies the object is a more evolved MYSO and this combined with large inner radius of the disk suggests that it could be an example of a transitional disk around an MYSO.},

Very similar to previous results that have been presented for various subsets of this survey, we confirm the positive correlation of the stellar multiplicities with primary mass. We find for the F- and G-type PopulationI stars that 58\% are non-single and 21\% are in triple or higher level systems. For the old intermediate-disk and PopulationII stars\textemdash virtually all of G type and less massive \textemdash even two out of three sources prove to be non-single. These numbers being lower limits because of the continuous flow of new discoveries, the unbiased survey clearly demonstrates that the standard case for solar-type field stars is a hydrogen-burning source with at least one ordinary or degenerate stellar companion, and a surprisingly large number of stars are organized in multiple systems. A principal consequence is that orbital evolution, including the formation of blue straggler stars, is a potentially important issue on all spatial scales and timescales for a significant percentage of the stellar systems, in particular among PopulationII stars. We discuss a number of recent observations of known or suspected companions in the local survey, including a new detection of a double-lined Ba-Bb subsystem to the visual binary HR 8635.},

Starting during the recombination era, the formation of the first molecules and molecular ions containing hydrogen, deuterium, helium, and lithium was severely hindered by the low density of the expanding Universe, the intensity of the cosmic radiation field, and the absence of solid catalyzers. Molecular hydrogen and deuterated hydrogen, the most abundant species formed in the gas phase prior to structure formation, played a fundamental role in the cooling of the gas clouds that gave birth to the first stellar generation, contributing to determine the scale of fragmentation. Primordial molecules also interacted with the photons of the cosmic background via resonant scattering, absorption, and emission. In this review, we examine the current status of the chemistry of the early Universe and discuss the most relevant reactions for which uncertainties still exist from theory or laboratory experiments. The prospects for detecting spectral distortions or spatial anisotropies due to the first atoms and molecules are also addressed.},

  abstract = {Hot, massive stars have strong stellar winds, and in hot-star binaries these winds can undergo violent collision. Because such winds are thought to be radiatively driven, radiative forces may also play an important role in moderating the wind collision. However, previous studies have been limited to considering how such forces may inhibit the initial acceleration of the companion stellar wind. In this paper we analyze the role of an even stronger radiative braking effect, whereby the primary wind is rather suddenly decelerated by the radiative momentum flux it encounters as it approaches a bright companion. We further show that the braking location and velocity law along the line of centers between the stars can be approximated analytically using a simple one-dimensional analysis. The results of this analysis agree well with a detailed two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of the wind collision in the WR + O binary V444 Cygni and demonstrate that radiative braking can significantly alter the bow-shock geometry and reduce the strength of the wind collision. We then apply the derived analytic theory to a set of 14 hot-star binary systems, and conclude that radiative braking is likely to be of widespread importance for wind-wind collisions in WR + O binaries with close to medium separation, D \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] lesssim 100 R {$\Sun$} . It may also be important in other types of hot-star binaries that exhibit a large imbalance between the component wind strengths.},

Recent years have seen rapid progress in our understanding of interstellar hydrides, thanks largely to FIR and submillimeter observations performed with the Herschel Space Observatory.

This code is called I2ELVIS and can solve a new class of computationally challenging problems in geodynamics, such as shear localization with large strains, crustal intrusion emplacement of magmas, bending of realistic visco-elasto-plastic plates and core-formation by vigorous shell tectonics activities related to a global Rayleigh\textendash Taylor instability of a metal layer formed around silicate-rich lower density (primordial) core during planetary accretion. We discuss in detail the computational strategy required the rheological constraints to be satisfied at each time step and spatial location. We show analytical benchmarks and examples drawn from comparing between numerical and analogue experiments in structural geology, subducting slab bending with a visco-elasto-plastic rheology and equilibrium spherical configurations from self-gravitation. We have also tested possibilities of future applications by addressing 3D geometries based on multigrid method and including inertial effects in the momentum equation with tracers in order to simulate meteoritic impact events and eventually earthquake instabilities.},

Under the assumption of negligible orbital motion, the nebular shell reaches a steady-state configuration. Its shape is roughly conical, with the cone apex angle determined by a single parameter. The time development of a cross-section of the nebula which forms in a system with nonnegligible orbital motion is also calculated, under the assumption that the nebular shell is thin relative to its overall dimensions.},

  abstract = {{$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We model the synthesis of molecules and dust in the inner wind of the oxygen-rich Mira-type star IK Tau by considering the effects of periodic shocks induced by the stellar pulsation on the gas and by following the non-equilibrium chemistry in the shocked gas layers between 1 R\textsubscript{{$\star$}} and 10 R\textsubscript{{$\star$}}. We consider a very complete set of molecules and dust clusters, and combine the nucleation phase of dust formation with the condensation of these clusters into dust grains. We also test the impact of increasing the local gas density. Our derived molecular abundances and dust properties are compared to the most recent observational data. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: A semi-analytical formalism based on parameterised fluid equations is used to describe the gas density, velocity, and temperature in the inner wind. The chemistry is described by using a chemical kinetic network of reactions and the condensation mechanism is described by a Brownian formalism. A set of stiff, ordinary, coupled differential equations is solved, and molecular abundances, dust cluster abundances, grain size distributions and dust masses are derived. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: The shocks drive an active non-equilibrium chemistry in the dust formation zone of IK Tau where the collision destruction of CO in the post-shock gas triggers the formation of C-bearing species such as HCN and CS. Most of the modelled molecular abundances agree well with the latest values derived from Herschel data, except for SO\textsubscript{2} and NH\textsubscript{3}, whose formation may not occur in the inner wind. Clusters of alumina, Al\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3}, are produced within 2 R\textsubscript{{$\star$}} and lead to a population of alumina grains close to the stellar surface. Clusters of silicates (Mg\textsubscript{2}SiO\textsubscript{4}) form at larger radii (r\&gt; 3R\textsubscript{{$\star$}}), where their nucleation is triggered by the formation of HSiO and H\textsubscript{2}SiO. They efficiently condense and reach their final grain size distribution between \textasciitilde 6 R\textsubscript{{$\star$}} and 8 R\textsubscript{{$\star$}} with a major population of medium size grains peaking at \textasciitilde 200 \AA. This two dust-shell configuration agrees with recent interferometric observations. The derived dust-to-gas mass ratio for IK Tau is in the range 1-6 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{-3} and agrees with values derived from observations of O-rich Mira-type stars. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: Our results confirm the importance of periodic shocks in chemically shaping the inner wind of AGB stars and providing gas conditions conducive to the efficient synthesis of molecules and dust by non-equilibrium processes. They indicate that the wind acceleration will possibly develop in the radius range 4-8 R\textsubscript{{$\star$}} in IK Tau.},

  abstract = {Hot massive stars present strong stellar winds that are driven by absorption, scattering, and reemission of photons by the ions of the atmosphere (line-driven winds). A better comprehension of this phenomenon, and a more accurate calculation of hydrodynamics and radiative acceleration, is Required to reduce the number of free parameters in spectral fitting and to determine accurate wind parameters such as mass-loss rates and velocity profiles. We use the non-LTE model-atmosphere code CMFGEN to numerically solve the radiative transfer equation in the stellar atmosphere and to calculate the radiative acceleration grad(r). Under the assumption that the radiative acceleration depends only on the radial coordinate, we solve analytically the equation of motion by means of the Lambert W-function. An iterative procedure between the solution of the radiative transfer and the equation of motion is executed in order to obtain a final self-consistent velocity field that is no longer based on any {$\beta$}-law. We apply the Lambert-procedure to three O supergiant stars ({$\zeta$} Puppis, HD 165763, and {$\alpha$} Cam) and discuss the Lambert solutions for the velocity profiles. It is found that, even without recalculation of the mass-loss rate, the Lambert-procedure allows the calculation of consistent velocity profiles that reduce the number of free parameters when a spectral fitting using CMFGEN is performed. Synthetic spectra calculated from our Lambert solutions show significant differences compared to the initial {$\beta$}-law CMFGEN models. The results indicate the importance of consistent velocity profile calculation in the CMFGEN code and its use in a fitting procedure and interpretation of observed spectra.},

Despite a nominal exposure of 20 ks and the high sensitivity of the satellite, the star itself is not detected: we thus derive an upper limit on its X-ray flux and luminosity. Joining this result to recent reports of a non-detection of some WC stars, we suggest that the X-ray emission from single normal Wolf-Rayet stars could often be insignificant despite remarkable instabilities in the wind. On the basis of a simple modelling of the opacity of the Wolf-Rayet wind of WR 40, we show that any X-ray emission generated in the particular zone where the shocks are supposed to be numerous will indeed have little chance to emerge from the dense wind of the Wolf-Rayet star. We also report the non-detection of the ejecta nebula RCW 58 surrounding WR 40. Concerning the field around these objects, we detected 33 X-ray sources, most of them previously unknown: we establish a catalog of these sources and cross-correlate it with catalogs of optical/infrared sources. {$<$}P /{$>$}Based on observations with XMM-Newton, an ESA Science Mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and the USA (NASA).},

Massive stars are more likely to form in massive star clusters (\&gt;1000 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}) than lower mass clusters. However, photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs from massive stars and dynamical interactions with passing stars can inhibit planet formation in clusters with radii of {$\sim$}1 pc. We investigate whether low-mass (50-200 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}) star clusters containing one or two massive stars are a more likely avenue for early Solar system enrichment as they are more dynamically quiescent. We analyse N-body simulations of the evolution of these low-mass clusters and find that a similar fraction of stars experience SN enrichment than in high-mass clusters, despite their lower densities. This is due to two-body relaxation, which causes a significant expansion before the first SN even in clusters with relatively low (100 stars pc\textsuperscript{-3}) initial densities. However, because of the high number of low-mass clusters containing one or two massive stars, the absolute number of enriched stars is the same, if not higher than for more populous clusters. Our results show that direct enrichment of protoplanetary discs from SNe occurs as frequently in low-mass clusters containing one or two massive stars (\&gt;20 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}) as in more populous star clusters (1000 M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}}).

  abstract = {Methods. We connect stellar structure models for He stars with wind models for optically-thick winds and assess how both types of models can simultaneously fulfill their respective sonic-point conditions. Results. Fixing the outer wind law and terminal wind velocity {$\infty$}, we obtain unique solutions for the mass-loss rates of opticallythick, radiatively-driven winds of WR stars in the phase of core He-burning. The resulting mass-loss relations as a function of stellar parameters, agree well with previous empirical relations. Furthermore, we encounter stellar mass limits below which no continuous solutions exist. While these mass limits agree with observations of WR stars in the Galaxy, they are in conflict with observations in the LMC. Conclusions. While our results confirm in particular the slope of oft-used empirical mass-loss relations, they imply that only part of the observed WN population can be understood in the framework of the standard assumptions of a smooth transonic flow and compact stellar core. This means that alternative approaches, such as a clumped and inflated wind structure, or deviations from the diffusion limit at the sonic point may have to be invoked. Qualitatively, the existence of mass limits for the formation of WR-type winds may be relevant for the non-detection of low-mass WR stars in binary systems, which are believed to be progenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae.

  abstract = {We present the first non-LTE atmosphere models for WR stars that incorporate a self-consistent solution of the hydrodynamic equations. The models take iron-group line-blanketing and clumping into account, and compute the hydrodynamic structure of a radiatively driven wind consistently with the non-LTE radiation transport in the co-moving frame. We construct a self-consistent wind model that reproduces all observed properties of an early-type WC star (WC5). We find that the WR-type mass-loss is initiated at high optical depth by the so-called ``Hot Iron Bump'' opacities (\textendash xvi). The acceleration of the outer wind regions is due to iron-group ions of lower excitation in combination with C and O. Consequently, the wind structure shows two acceleration regions, one close to the hydrostatic wind base in the optically thick part of the atmosphere, and another farther out in the wind. In addition to the radiative acceleration, the ``Iron Bump'' opacities are responsible for an intense heating of deep atmospheric layers. We find that the observed narrow emission lines in the optical spectra of WC stars originate from this region. From their dependence on the clumping factor we gain important information about the location where the density inhomogeneities in WR-winds start to develop.},

Using a roofline analysis we demonstrate that the overall performance is currently limited by DRAM bandwidth and calculate a performance portability metric of 62.8\%. Finally, we present the implementation strategies used and the challenges encountered in maximizing performance.

  abstract = {The interaction between the strong winds in stellar colliding-wind binary (CWB) systems produces two shock fronts, delimiting the wind-collision region (WCR). There, particles are expected to be accelerated mainly via diffusive shock acceleration. We investigate the injection and acceleration of protons in typical CWB systems by means of Monte Carlo simulations, with both a test-particle approach and a nonlinear method modeling a shock locally modified by the backreaction of the accelerated protons. We use magnetohydrodynamic simulations to determine the background plasma in the WCR and its vicinity. This allows us to consider particle acceleration at both shocks, on either side of the WCR, with a realistic large-scale magnetic field. We highlight the possible effects of particle acceleration on the local shock profiles at the WCR. We include the effect of magnetic field amplification, due to resonant-streaming instability, and compare results without and with the backreaction of the accelerated protons. In the latter case, we find a lower flux of the nonthermal proton population and a considerable magnetic field amplification. This would significantly increase the synchrotron losses of relativistic electrons accelerated in CWB systems, lowering the maximal energy they can reach and strongly reducing the inverse Compton fluxes. As a result, {$\gamma$}-rays from CWBs would be predominantly due to the decay of neutral pions produced in nucleon-nucleon collisions. This might provide a way to explain why, in the vast majority of cases, CWB systems have not been identified as {$\gamma$}-ray sources, although they emit synchrotron radiation.},

  abstract = {Cosmic-ray acceleration has been a long-standing mystery1,2 and, despite more than a century of study, we still do not have a complete census of acceleration mechanisms. The collision of strong stellar winds in massive binary systems creates powerful shocks that have been expected to produce high-energy cosmic rays through Fermi acceleration at the shock interface. The accelerated particles should collide with stellar photons or ambient material, producing non-thermal emission observable in X-rays and {$\gamma$}-rays3,4. The supermassive binary star Eta Carinae ({$\eta$} Car) drives the strongest colliding wind shock in the solar neighbourhood5,6. Observations with non-focusing high-energy observatories indicate a high-energy source near {$\eta$} Car, but have been unable to conclusively identify {$\eta$} Car as the source because of their relatively poor angular resolution7\textendash 9. Here we present direct focussing observations of the non-thermal source in the extremely hard X-ray band, which is found to be spatially coincident with the star within several arc-seconds. These observations show that the source of non-thermal X-rays varies with the orbital phase of the binary, and that the photon index of the emission is similar to that derived through analysis of the {$\gamma$}-ray spectrum. This is conclusive evidence that the high-energy emission indeed originates from non-thermal particles accelerated at colliding wind shocks.},

Observational data pointed to a hierarchical triple-star system, however, several extreme and unexpected physical properties seem to defy the established physics of such objects. Most notably, a stark discrepancy was found in the observed outflow speed of the gas as measured spectroscopically in the line-of-sight direction compared to the proper motion expansion of the dust in the sky plane. This enigmatic behaviour arises at the wind base within the central Wolf\textendash Rayet binary: a system that has so far remained spatially unresolved. Here, we present an updated proper motion study deriving the expansion speed of Apep's dust plume over a 2-year baseline that is four times slower than the spectroscopic wind speed, confirming and strengthening the previous finding. We also present the results from high angular resolution near-infrared imaging studies of the heart of the system, revealing a close binary with properties matching a Wolf\textendash Rayet colliding-wind system. Based on these new observational constraints, an improved geometric model is presented yielding a close match to the data, constraining the orbital parameters of the Wolf\textendash Rayet binary and lending further support to the anisotropic wind model.},

  abstract = {We present radiative-transfer modelling of the dusty spiral Pinwheel Nebula observed around the Wolf\textendash Rayet/OB-star binary WR 104. The models are based on the three-dimensional radiative-transfer code torus, modified to include an adaptive mesh that allows us to adequately resolve both the inner spiral turns (subau scales) and the outer regions of the nebula (distances of 104 au from the central source). The spiral model provides a good fit to both the spectral energy distribution and Keck aperture masking interferometry, reproducing both the maximum entropy recovered images and the visibility curves. We deduce a dust creation rate of 8 {$\pm$} 1 \texttimes{} 10-7 M{$\odot$} yr-1, corresponding to approximately 2 per cent by mass of the carbon produced by the Wolf\textendash Rayet star. Simultaneous modelling of the imaging and spectral data enables us to constrain both the opening angle of the wind\textendash wind collision interface and the dust grain size. We conclude that the dust grains in the inner part of the Pinwheel Nebula are small ({$\sim$}100 \AA ), in agreement with theoretical predictions, although we cannot rule out the presence of larger grains ({$\sim$}1 {$\mu$}m) further from the central binary. The opening angle of the wind\textendash wind collision interface appears to be about 40\textdegree, in broad agreement with the wind parameters estimated for the central binary. We discuss the success and deficiencies of the model, and the likely benefits of applying similar techniques to the more complex nebulae observed around other WR/O star binaries.},

  abstract = {The Wolf\textendash Rayet 98a (WR 98a) system is a prime target for interferometric surveys, since its identification as a `rotating pinwheel nebulae', where infrared images display a spiral dust lane revolving with a 1.4 yr periodicity. WR 98a hosts a WC9+OB star, and the presence of dust is puzzling given the extreme luminosities of Wolf\textendash Rayet stars. We present 3D hydrodynamic models for WR 98a, where dust creation and redistribution are self-consistently incorporated. Our grid-adaptive simulations resolve details in the wind collision region at scales below one percent of the orbital separation ({$\sim$}4 au), while simulating up to 1300 au. We cover several orbital periods under conditions where the gas component alone behaves adiabatic, or is subject to effective radiative cooling. In the adiabatic case, mixing between stellar winds is effective in a well-defined spiral pattern, where optimal conditions for dust creation are met. When radiative cooling is incorporated, the interaction gets dominated by thermal instabilities along the wind collision region, and dust concentrates in clumps and filaments in a volume-filling fashion, so WR 98a must obey close to adiabatic evolutions to demonstrate the rotating pinwheel structure. We mimic Keck, ALMA or future E-ELT observations and confront photometric long-term monitoring. We predict an asymmetry in the dust distribution between leading and trailing edge of the spiral, show that ALMA and E-ELT would be able to detect fine-structure in the spiral indicative of Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz development, and confirm the variation in photometry due to the orientation. Historic Keck images are reproduced, but their resolution is insufficient to detect the details we predict.},

  abstract = {We present theoretical X-ray line profiles from a range of model colliding wind systems. In particular, we investigate the effects of varying the stellar mass-loss rates, the wind speeds and the viewing orientation. We find that a wide range of theoretical line profile shapes is possible, varying with orbital inclination and phase. At or near conjunction, the lines have approximately Gaussian profiles, with small widths (HWHM {$\sim$} 0.1v{$\infty$}) and definite blueshifts or redshifts (depending on whether the star with the weaker wind is in front or behind). When the system is viewed at quadrature, the lines are generally much broader (HWHM {$\sim$} v{$\infty$}), flat-topped and unshifted. Local absorption can have a major effect on the observed profiles \textendash{} in systems with mass-loss rates of a few times 10-6 M yr-1 the lower energy lines (E 1 keV) are particularly affected. This generally results in blueward-skewed profiles, especially when the system is viewed through the dense wind of the primary. The orbital variation of the linewidths and shifts is reduced in a low-inclination binary. The extreme case is a binary with i = 0{$\smwhtcircle$}, for which we would expect no line profile variation.},

Protostars and Planets VI brings together more than 250 contributing authors at the forefront of their field, conveying the latest results in this research area and establishing a new foundation for advancing our understanding of stellar and planetary formation. Continuing the tradition of the Protostars and Planets series, this latest volume uniquely integrates the cross-disciplinary aspects of this broad field. Covering an extremely wide range of scales, from the formation of large clouds in our Milky Way galaxy down to small chondrules in our solar system, Protostars and Planets VI takes an encompassing view with the goal of not only highlighting what we know but, most importantly, emphasizing the frontiers of what we do not know. As a vehicle for propelling forward new discoveries on stars, planets, and their origins, this latest volume in the Space Science Series is an indispensable resource for both current scientists and new students in astronomy, astrophysics, planetary science, and the study of meteorites.},

  abstract = {Of the over 150 different molecular species detected in the interstellar and circumstellar media, approximately 50 contain 6 or more atoms. These molecules, labeled complex by astronomers if not by chemists, all contain the element carbon and so can be called organic. In the interstellar medium, complex molecules are detected in the denser sources only. Although, with one exception, complex molecules have only been detected in the gas phase, there is strong evidence that they can be formed in ice mantles on interstellar grains. The nature of the gaseous complex species depends dramatically on the source where they are found: in cold, dense regions they tend to be unsaturated (hydrogen-poor) and exotic, whereas in young stellar objects, they tend to be quite saturated (hydrogen-rich) and terrestrial in nature. Based on both their spectra and chemistry, complex molecules are excellent probes of the physical conditions and history of the sources where they reside. Because they are detected in young stellar objects, complex molecules are expected to be common ingredients for new planetary systems. In this review, we discuss both the observation and chemistry of complex molecules in assorted interstellar regions in the Milky Way.},

We enumerate the major surveys of CO emission along the Galactic plane and summarize the various approaches that leverage these data to determine the large-scale distribution of molecular gas: its radial and vertical distributions, its concentration into clouds, and its relationship to spiral structure. The integrated properties of molecular clouds are compiled from catalogs derived from the CO surveys using uniform assumptions regarding the Galactic rotation curve, solar radius, and the CO-to-H2 conversion factor. We discuss the radial variations of cloud surface brightness, the distributions of cloud mass and size, and scaling relations between velocity dispersion, cloud size, and surface density that affirm that the larger clouds are gravitationally bound. Measures of density structure and gas kinematics within nearby, well-resolved clouds are examined and attributed to the effects of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We review the arguments for short, intermediate, and long molecular lifetimes based on the observational record. The review concludes with questions that shall require further observational attention.},

The dust particles gain momentum by absorption or scattering of stellar photons, and they drag along the surrounding gas particles through collisions, triggering an outflow. This scenario, here referred to as Pulsation-Enhanced Dust-DRiven Outflow (PEDDRO), has passed a range of critical observational tests as models have developed from empirical and qualitative to increasingly self-consistent and quantitative. A reliable theory of mass loss is an essential piece in the bigger picture of stellar and galactic chemical evolution, and central for determining the contribution of AGB stars to the dust budget of galaxies. In this review, I discuss the current understanding of wind acceleration and indicate areas where further efforts by theorists and observers are needed.},

In many applications, allowing the time step size to change in time can offer a great saving in computational cost, but variable-size time steps usually imply a substantial degradation in energy conservation. We present a meta-algorithm' for choosing time steps in such a way as to guarantee time symmetry in any integration scheme, thus allowing vastly improved energy conservation for orbital calculations with variable time steps. We apply the algorithm to the familiar leapfrog scheme, and generalize to higher order integration schemes, showing how the stability properties of the fixed-step leapfrog scheme can be extended to higher order, variable-step integrators such as the Hermite method. We illustrate the remarkable properties of these time-symmetric integrators for the case of a highly eccentric elliptical Kepler orbit and discuss applications to more complex problems.},

  abstract = {The characteristics of many close, evolved binaries can be understood most easily if there exists some agency that can abstract angular momentum or mass, or both, from the precursor system. Close binaries may be defined as systems in which at least one of the components has filled or will fill its Roche lobe and attempt to transfer matter to its companion. If the timescale for mass transfer is considerablyy shorter than the timescale on which the accretor can adjust thermally to the proferred mass, the accreted layer will heat up, expand, and fill the Roche lobe of the accretor. The mass lost by the donor thereafter flows into a "common envelope" (CE) which encomapsses both stars. The frictional interaction between this common envelope and the stellar cores produces drag forces that cause the cores to spiral in toward one another; some of the orbital energy helps drive matter from the CE into interstellar space. Examples of the systems which are experiencing or have experienced this process include some planetary nebulae, cataclysmic variables, and close binary degenerate stars. Similar situations can arise if one of the components can support, of its own accord, a dense wind that flows out of the system; the drag luminosity produced by interaction between the companion and the wind may intensify the wind and contribute tot eh mass loss from the donor. Systems undergoing this "wind-CE" process include novae and close binaries containing a Wolf-Rayet star. Planetary nebulae with close binary central stars are actually ejected CEs, and precursors of many cataclysmic variables were once the central stars of planetary nebulae formed in a CE event. In this review, we (1) describe various initial configurations which will produce a CE, (2) discuss the physics of the CE event, (3) describe attempts to model the event quantiatively, and (4) apply what we have learned to describe, in several real situations, the tarnsformations wrought by evolution through a CE phase.

  abstract = {Destruction of interstellar dust occurs predominantly in supernova shock waves in the warm neutral/ionized medium (density approximately = 0.25/cu cm, temperature approximately = 104 K). Recent theoretical developments and laboratory data for sputtering processes and grain-grain collisional vaporization allows us to better evaluate the grain destruction rate in interstellar shocks in the warm medium. We find that, independent of composition, grain destruction in supernova blast waves is dominated by nonthermal sputtering for shock velocities greater than 50 km/s and less than or equal to 150 km/s and thermal sputtering at higher shock velocities. We use a detailed scheme for the vaporization of grains colliding at high velocities (vs greater than or equal to 20 km/s) and show that the grain-grain collision destruction process is only dominant for shock velocities of less than or equal to 50-80 km/s and is less important than previously assumed. Nevertheless, the grain-grain destruction rates are of order 30\%-90\% of the sputtering rates at vs greater than 100 km/s and less than 200 km/s and are important in vaporizing the cores of grains. Detailed results for grain destruction as a function of grain size and composition are presented. We also present results for silicon carbide, iron, ice, and porous test particles. For carbonaceous grains we find that the fractional destruction is less than or equal to 0.29, and for silicate it is less than or equal to 0.45, for vs less than or equal to 200 km/s. We have calculated grain lifetimes, using the three-phase model of the interstellar medium, and find lifetimes of 4 x 108 yr for carbonaceous grains and 2.2 x 108 yr for silicate grains. Given that the typical stardust injection timescale of 2.5 x 109 yr, we conclude that efficient mechanisms for grain growth in the interstellar medium must exist in order that a significant fraction of the refractory elements be incorporated in dust, as observed. Therefore, although our improved model has less vaporization of dust due to grain-grain collisions, sputtering still destroys dust efficiently and grain mantle growth in the interstellar medium is required, a conclusion reached in previous models of grain destruction in the interstellar medium. Carbonaceous mantles on silicate grains can protect the silicate cores from sputtering destruction in interstellar shock waves, provided that the protective mantles can efficiently reform in the interstellar medium. Also, if the grains are porous the postshock grain velocities are lower than for solid particles, and grain destruction is reduced. Porosity and mantling may increase the grain lifetime by factors of approximately 3 and approximately 3-4, respectively. The fraction of interstellar silicon in silicate stardust is therefore less than or equal to 0.25, but more silicon might be depleted in the form of a grain mantle.},

  abstract = {We have studied the effects of shattering in grain-grain collisions. Based upon extensive numerical simulation of surface explosions and impacts, an analytical model has been developed which relates the final crater mass and fragment size distribution to the relative collision velocity, grain sizes, and material properties of projectile and target. Our model contains one free parameter, the critical shock pressure for shattering. We have compared the calculated crater masses to laboratory experiments on (sub)micron-sized particle impacts on a wide variety of materials and find good agreement assuming that the critical pressure for shattering is equal to the shear strength of the material. This critical pressure corresponds to minimum collision velocities of {$\sim$}1 km s-1 for shattering to occur. The shattering threshold is much smaller than the vaporization threshold, and we therefore conclude that shattering dominates over vaporization in grain-grain collisions. The calculated size distribution of the shattered fragments scales with a a-3.3; slightly less steep than the Mathis, Rumpl, \& Nordsieck (MRN) size distribution. Essentially, any shattering model where the size of the fragments is related to the pressure experienced will lead to fragment power-law size distributions with indices slightly steeper than {$\sim$}3. The maximum fragment size increases with increasing crater size (i.e., increasing collision velocity) until the target grain is completely disrupted by the collision. For higher velocity collisions, our theory predicts that the maximum shattered fragment size will decrease again. Dust destruction (return of grain mass to the gas) in the interstellar medium occurs predominantly in shock waves in the warm neutral/ionized medium (density {$\simeq$}0.25 cm-3, temperature {$\sim$}104 K). The new theory for grain shattering in grain-grain collisions has been incorporated into a grain destruction code and used to reevaluate the grain destruction rate in interstellar shocks in the warm medium. We find that, for all the grain materials we consider (graphite, silicate, silicon carbide, diamond, iron, and ice) nonthermal and thermal sputtering dominate the grain destruction. We also find that grain disruption (shattering) in grain-grain collisions dominates the grain mass redistribution. We present detailed results for grain destruction as a function of the grain size and composition. In particular, we consider MRN size distributions of silicate and carbonaceous (amorphous carbon/ graphite) grains. We also present results for silicon carbide, diamond, iron, and ice test particles. For both carbonaceous and silicate grains we find that the fractional destruction (i.e., return of solid material to the gas phase) is {$\leq$}0.5, for vs {$\leq$}200 km s-1 . The grain lifetimes against destruction, assuming the three-phase model of the interstellar medium, are 6 x 108 yr, and 4 x 108 yr, for carbonaceous and silicate grains, respectively, only slightly longer than previous studies that ignored shattering. Grain shattering in grain-grain collisions in shock waves leads to the redistribution of the dust mass from large grains (a {$\geq$} 1000 \AA ) into small grains (a {$<$} 500 \AA ). After processing by a single shock, a major fraction of the grains larger than 300 A have experienced shattering grain-grain collisions. The slope of the fragment size distribution produced in single collisions has little influence on the size distribution produced by shocks. Essentially, the resulting grain size distribution is slightly steeper than MRN, because the largest grains move at the highest postshock velocities and hence are preferentially shattered into the smallest fragments. Large grains are lost from the interstellar grain size distribution on time scales less than 108 yr in the warm medium. For 50 km s-1 {$\leq$} vs {$\leq$} 200 km s-1 as much as 5\%-15\% of the initial grain mass (all grain radii {$\geq$} 50 \AA ) may end up in sub-14 \AA{} fragments. Thus, interstellar shocks may be a prodigious source of PAH molecules, PAH clusters, and small grains. Given that the typical stardust injection time scale is 2.5 x 109 yr, we conclude that efficient mechanisms for grain growth, and in particular, the reformation of grains with radii{$>$} 1000 \AA, must exist in interstellar medium in order that the refractory elements be incorporated in dust and that most of the dust mass is in sizes {$\geq$} 1000 \AA, as observed.},

The interstellar grains in the cocoon absorb the direct starlight, and re-emit in the infra-red. In many cases the cocoon is also opaque to this reradiated radiation, and therefore a gradient of radiation pressure builds up and retards the infalling material. As the mass of the central star grows, and its luminosity-to-mass ratio increases, this effect becomes more important. Eventually the retardation becomes so severe that the infalling gas and dust mixture cannot cross the surface where the grains melt. Once this has happened, the flow is turned back and a dense shell of interstellar mixture begins to be driven away from the star. However, the shell is unstable, and will probably break up into fragments. This process sets a limit to the luminosity to mass ratio L:M of those stars which can accrete interstellar matter.},

First results suggest that it is teeming with a fascinating diversity of rocky planets, including those in the habitable zone. Even our closest star, Proxima Centauri, harbors a small planet in its habitable zone, Proxima b. With the next generation of telescopes, we will be able to peer into the atmospheres of rocky planets and get a glimpse into other worlds. Using our own planet and its wide range of biota as a Rosetta stone, we explore how we could detect habitability and signs of life on exoplanets over interstellar distances. Current telescopes are not yet powerful enough to characterize habitable exoplanets, but the next generation of telescopes that is already being built will have the capabilities to characterize close-by habitable worlds. The discussion on what makes a planet a habitat and how to detect signs of life is lively. This review will show the latest results, the challenges of how to identify and characterize such habitable worlds, and how near-future telescopes will revolutionize the field. For the first time in human history, we have developed the technology to detect potential habitable worlds.

  abstract = {Feedback from massive stars plays a key role in molecular cloud evolution. After the onset of star formation, the young stellar population is exposed by photoionization, winds, supernovae, and radiation pressure from massive stars. Recent observations of nearby galaxies have provided the evolutionary timeline between molecular clouds and exposed young stars, but the duration of the embedded phase of massive star formation is still ill-constrained. We measure how long massive stellar populations remain embedded within their natal cloud, by applying a statistical method to six nearby galaxies at 20-100 pc resolution, using CO, Spitzer 24 {$\mu$}m, and H {$\alpha$} emission as tracers of molecular clouds, embedded star formation, and exposed star formation, respectively. We find that the embedded phase (with CO and 24 {$\mu$}m emission) lasts for 2-7 Myr and constitutes 17-47 per cent of the cloud lifetime. During approximately the first half of this phase, the region is invisible in H {$\alpha$}, making it heavily obscured. For the second half of this phase, the region also emits in H {$\alpha$} and is partially exposed. Once the cloud has been dispersed by feedback, 24 {$\mu$}m emission no longer traces ongoing star formation, but remains detectable for another 2-9 Myr through the emission from ambient CO-dark gas, tracing star formation that recently ended. The short duration of massive star formation suggests that pre-supernova feedback (photoionization and winds) is important in disrupting molecular clouds. The measured time-scales do not show significant correlations with environmental properties (e.g. metallicity). Future JWST observations will enable these measurements routinely across the nearby galaxy population.},

We compare our results with the approximations and cross section used by other authors.

We also provide cross sections for the production of electron positron pairs from energetic photons when they interact with air molecules. This process is related to the Bremsstrahlung process by some physical symmetry. Therefore the results above can be transferred to predictions on the angles between incident photon and emitted positron, again as a function of photon and positron energy. We present the distribution of angles and again a simple approximation for the most probable scattering angle.

  abstract = {{$\blacksquare$} Abstract\hspace{0.6em} Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within {$\sim$}2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4\textendash 7\% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M               {$\odot$}               . Moreover, observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70\textendash 90\%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we show how the two-fluid equations describing the evolution of a dust and gas mixture can be re-formulated to describe a single fluid moving with the barycentric velocity of the mixture. This leads to evolution equations for the total density, momentum, the differential velocity between the dust and the gas phases and either the dust-to-gas ratio or the dust fraction. The equations are similar to the usual equations of gas dynamics, providing a convenient way to extend existing codes to simulate two-fluid mixtures without modifying the code architecture. Our approach avoids the inherent difficulties related to the standard approach where the two phases are separate and coupled via a drag term. In particular, the requirements of infinite spatial and temporal resolution as the stopping time tends to zero are no longer necessary. This means that both small and large grains can be straightforwardly treated with the same method, with no need for complicated implicit schemes. Since there is only one resolution scale the method also avoids the problem of unphysical trapping of one fluid (e.g. dust) below the resolution of the other. We also derive a simplified set of equations applicable to the case of strong drag/small grains, consisting of the standard fluid equations with a modified sound speed, plus an advection\textendash diffusion equation for the dust-to-gas ratio. This provides a simple and fast way to evolve the mixture when the stopping time is smaller than the Courant time step. We present a smoothed particle hydrodynamics implementation in a companion paper.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present the analytic solutions for two test problems involving two-fluid mixtures of dust and gas in an astrophysical context. The solutions provide a means of benchmarking numerical codes designed to simulate the non-linear dynamics of dusty gas. The first problem, DUSTYBOX, consists of two interpenetrating homogeneous fluids moving with relative velocity difference. We provide exact solutions to the full non-linear problem for a range of drag formulations appropriate to astrophysical fluids (i.e. various prescriptions for Epstein and Stokes drag in different regimes). The second problem, DUSTYWAVE, consists of the propagation of linear acoustic waves in a two-fluid gas\textendash dust mixture. We provide the analytic solution for the case when the two fluids are interacting via a linear drag term. Both test problems are simple to set up in any numerical code and can be run with periodic boundary conditions. The solutions we derive are completely general with respect to both the dust-to-gas ratio and the amplitude of the drag coefficient. A stability analysis of waves in a gas\textendash dust system is also presented, showing that sound waves in an astrophysical dust\textendash gas mixture are linearly stable.},

  abstract = {Context. The collision of winds from massive stars in binaries results  in the formation of a double-shock structure with observed signatures from radio to X-rays. Aims: We study the structure and stability of the colliding wind region as it turns into a spiral owing to the orbital motion. We focus on adiabatic winds, where mixing between the two winds is expected to be restricted to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. Mixing of the Wolf-Rayet wind with hydrogen-rich material is important for dust formation in pinwheel nebulae such as WR 104, where the spiral structure has been resolved in infrared.  Methods: We use the hydrodynamical code RAMSES to solve the equations of hydrodynamics on an adaptive grid. A wide range of binary systems with different wind velocities and mass-loss rates are studied with two-dimensional simulations. A specific three-dimensional simulation is performed to model WR 104. Results: Orbital motion leads to the formation of two distinct spiral arms where the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability develops differently. We find that the spiral structure is destroyed when there is a large velocity gradient between the winds, unless the collimated wind is much faster. We argue that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability plays a major role in determining whether the structure is maintained. We discuss the consequences for various colliding-wind binaries. When their spiral structure is stable, there is no straightforward relationship between the spatial step of the spiral, the wind velocities, and the orbital period. Our 3D simulation of WR 104 indicates that the colder, well-mixed trailing arm has more favourable conditions for dust formation than the leading arm. The single-arm infrared spiral follows more closely the mixing map than the density map, suggesting that the dust-to-gas ratio may vary between the leading and trailing density spirals. However, the density is much lower than what dust formation models require. Including radiative cooling would lead to higher densities, and also to thin shell instabilities whose impact on the large-scale structure remains unknown.

It describes the structure and evolution of stars, with emphasis on the basic physical principles and the interplay between the different processes inside stars such as nuclear reactions, energy transport, chemical mixing, pulsation, mass loss, and rotation. Based on these principles, the evolution of low- and high-mass stars is explained from their formation to their death. In addition to homework exercises for each chapter, the text contains a large number of questions that are meant to stimulate the understanding of the physical principles. An extensive set of accompanying lecture slides is available for teachers in both Keynote\textregistered{} and PowerPoint\textregistered{} formats.},

The durations of the different evolutionary stages of massive core helium burning stars, which may be defined in terms of their surface chemical composition, have been estimated. This could be done by relating the time evolution of the surface hydrogen mass fraction to the interior hydrogen profile of stars at He-ignition via their average rates of mass loss due to stellar wind. Several observational details can be explained in this way, especially the high mean mass of WNL stars and the low mean mass of WNE stars. Further it is suggested that very massive stars explode as WNL stars.},

We present observations from our Early Release Science programme (ERS 1349) with the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium-Resolution Spectrometer and Imager that reveal the spectral and spatial signatures of nested circumstellar dust shells around WR 140. MIRI medium-resolution spectroscopy of the second dust shell and Imager detections of over 17 shells formed throughout approximately the past 130\,years confirm the survival of carbonaceous dust grains from WR 140 that are probably carriers of `unidentified infrared'-band features at 6.4 and 7.7\,{$\mu$}m.

We interpret the mid-IR variability from SPIRITS 16ln as a dust-formation episode in an eccentric colliding-wind WC binary. SPIRITS 19q, 16df, 14apu, and 18hb exhibit absolute [3.6] magnitudes exceeding that of one of the most IR-luminous dust-forming WC systems known, WR 104 (M [3.6] {$\lessequivlnt$} -12.3). An analysis of dust formation in the mid-IR outburst from SPIRITS 19q reveals a high dust production rate of M {$\odot$} yr-1, which may therefore exceed that of the most efficient dust-forming WC systems known. We demonstrate that efficient dust formation is feasible from early-type WC binaries in the theoretical framework of colliding-wind binary dust formation if the systems host an O-type companion with high mass-loss rates ( M {$\odot$} yr-1). This efficient dust formation from early-type WC binaries highlights their potential role as significant sources of dust in low-metallicity environments.},

DustEM SED models of 19 Galactic WC ``dustars'' reveal DPRs of M{$\odot$} yr-1 and carbon dust condensation fractions, {$\chi$}C, between 0.002\% and 40\%. A large (0.1\textendash 1.0 {$\mu$}m) dust grain size composition is favored for efficient dustars where {$\chi$}C {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1\%. Results for dustars with known orbital periods verify a power-law relation between {$\chi$}C, orbital period, WC mass-loss rate, and wind velocity consistent with predictions from theoretical models of dust formation in colliding-wind binaries. We incorporated dust production into Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) models to analyze dust production rates from WC dustars, asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs), red supergiants (RSGs), and core-collapse supernovae (SNe). BPASS models assuming constant star formation (SF) and a coeval 106 M{$\odot$} stellar population were performed at low, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)\textendash like, and solar metallicities (Z = 0.001, 0.008, and 0.020). Both constant SF and coeval models indicate that SNe are net dust destroyers at all metallicities. Constant SF models at LMC-like metallicities show that AGB stars slightly outproduce WC binaries and RSGs by factors of 2\textendash 3, whereas at solar metallicities WC binaries are the dominant source of dust for {$\sim$}60 Myr until the onset of AGBs, which match the dust input of WC binaries. Coeval population models show that, for ``bursty'' SF, AGB stars dominate dust production at late times (t {$\greaterequivlnt$} 70 Myr).},

  abstract = {For decades, a subset of carbon-rich WR (WC) stars have been known to actively form dust despite their extreme environments. Although these systems can produce copious amounts of dust, they have been commonly overlooked as significant sources of dust in the ISM of galaxies in the local and early Universe due to the persisting mysteries on their dust formation and the influence of binary companions. In this talk, I will discuss the results and plans from our research program that combines archival data thermal IR observations, new imaging and spectroscopic data from Subaru/COMICS, and approved Early Release Science observations with JWST in Cycle 1. I will highlight our major results that uniquely combine a comprehensive dust SED analysis of Galactic dust-forming WC stars with Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) models and show that WC binaries are early sources and significant sources of dust at LMC-like and solar metallicities in constant star-forming environments.},

One of the SMA sources was observed to power a massive collimated 12CO outflow extending at least 0.94pc in both directions from the protostar, with a total mass of 0.83M{$\Sun$} and a dynamical timescale of 23kyr.},

  abstract = {The thermal history and internal structure of chondritic planetesimals, assembled before the giant impact phase of chaotic growth, potentially yield important implications for the final composition and evolution of terrestrial planets. These parameters critically depend on the internal balance of heating versus cooling, which is mostly determined by the presence of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs), such as 26Al and 60Fe, as well as the heat conductivity of the material. The heating by SLRs depends on their initial abundances, the formation time of the planetesimal and its size. It has been argued that the cooling history is determined by the porosity of the granular material, which undergoes dramatic changes via compaction processes and tends to decrease with time. In this study we assess the influence of these parameters on the thermo-mechanical evolution of young planetesimals with both 2D and 3D simulations. Using the code family I2ELVIS/I3ELVIS we have run numerous 2D and 3D numerical finite-difference fluid dynamic models with varying planetesimal radius, formation time and initial porosity. Our results indicate that powdery materials lowered the threshold for melting and convection in planetesimals, depending on the amount of SLRs present. A subset of planetesimals retained a powdery surface layer which lowered the thermal conductivity and hindered cooling. The effect of initial porosity was small, however, compared to those of planetesimal size and formation time, which dominated the thermo-mechanical evolution and were the primary factors for the onset of melting and differentiation. We comment on the implications of this work concerning the structure and evolution of these planetesimals, as well as their behavior as possible building blocks of terrestrial planets.},

The evolution of the coupled core-mantle-atmosphere system of growing protoplanets diverges in thermal, compositional, and structural states to first order, and ultimately shapes key planetary characteristics that can discern planets harboring clement surface conditions from those that do not.

The subsequent thermo-mechanical evolution, such as internal differentiation or rapid volatile degassing, yields important implications for the final structure, composition and evolution of terrestrial planets. SLR-driven heating in the Solar system is sensitive to the absolute abundance and homogeneity of SLRs within the protoplanetary disc present during the condensation of the first solids. In order to explain the diverse compositions found for extrasolar planets, it is important to understand the distribution of SLRs in active planet formation regions (star clusters) during their first few Myr of evolution. By constraining the range of possible effects, we show how the imprint of SLRs can be extrapolated to exoplanetary systems and derive statistical predictions for the distribution of 26Al and 60Fe based on N-body simulations of typical to large clusters (103-104 stars) with a range of initial conditions. We quantify the pollution of protoplanetary discs by supernova ejecta and show that the likelihood of enrichment levels similar to or higher than the Solar system can vary considerably, depending on the cluster morphology. Furthermore, many enriched systems show an excess in radiogenic heating compared to Solar system levels, which implies that the formation and evolution of planetesimals could vary significantly depending on the birth environment of their host stars.},

The total budget and fractionation between C-H-O species sensitively affect the climatic and geodynamic state of terrestrial worlds, but their main delivery channels are poorly constrained. We connect numerical models of volatile chemistry and pebble coagulation in the circumstellar disk with the internal compositional evolution of planetesimals during the primary accretion phase. Our simulations demonstrate that disk chemistry and degassing from planetesimals operate on comparable timescales and can fractionate the relative abundances of major water and carbon carriers by orders of magnitude. As a result, individual planetary systems with significant planetesimal processing display increased correlation in the volatile budget of planetary building blocks relative to no internal heating. Planetesimal processing in a subset of systems increases the variance of volatile contents across planetary systems. Our simulations thus suggest that exoplanetary atmospheric compositions may provide constraints on when a specific planet formed.},

However, the distribution of compositionally Earth-like planets remains insufficiently constrained3, and it is not clear whether the Solar System is a statistical outlier or can be explained by more general planetary formation processes. Here we use numerical models of planet formation, evolution and interior structure to show that a planet's bulk water fraction and radius are anti-correlated with initial 26Al levels in the planetesimal-based accretion framework. The heat generated by this short-lived radionuclide rapidly dehydrates planetesimals8 before their accretion onto larger protoplanets and yields a system-wide correlation9,10 of planetary bulk water abundances, which, for instance, can explain the lack of a clear orbital trend in the water budgets of the TRAPPIST-1 planets11. Qualitatively, our models suggest two main scenarios for the formation of planetary systems: high-26Al systems, like our Solar System, form small, water-depleted planets, whereas those devoid of 26Al predominantly form ocean worlds. For planets of similar mass, the mean planetary transit radii of the ocean planet population can be up to about 10\% larger than for planets from the 26Al-rich formation scenario.},

  abstract = {We developed and tested an efficient 2D numerical methodology for modeling gravitational redistribution processes in a quasi spherical planetary body based on a simple Cartesian grid. This methodology allows one to implement large viscosity contrasts and to handle properly a free surface and self-gravitation. With this novel method we investigated in a simplified way the evolution of gravitationally unstable global three-layer structures in the interiors of large metal\textendash silicate planetary bodies like those suggested by previous models of cold accretion [Sasaki, S., Nakazawa, K., 1986. J. Geophys. Res. 91, 9231\textendash 9238; Karato, S., Murthy, V.R., 1997. Phys. Earth Planet Interios 100, 61\textendash 79; Senshu, H., Kuramoto, K., Matsui, T., 2002. J. Geophys. Res. 107 (E12), 5118. 10.1029/2001JE001819]: an innermost solid protocore (either undifferentiated or partly differentiated), an intermediate metal-rich layer (either continuous or disrupted), and an outermost silicate-rich layer. Long-wavelength (degree-one) instability of this three-layer structure may strongly contribute to core formation dynamics by triggering planetary-scale gravitational redistribution processes. We studied possible geometrical modes of the resulting planetary reshaping using scaled 2D numerical experiments for self-gravitating planetary bodies with Mercury-, Mars- and Earth-size. In our simplified model the viscosity of each material remains constant during the experiment and rheological effects of gravitational energy dissipation are not taken into account. However, in contrast to a previously conducted numerical study [Honda, R., Mizutani, H., Yamamoto, T., 1993. J. Geophys. Res. 98, 2075\textendash 2089] we explored a freely deformable planetary surface and a broad range of viscosity ratios between the metallic layer and the protocore (0.001\textendash 1000) as well as between the silicate layer and the protocore (0.001\textendash 1000). An important new prediction from our study is that realistic modes of planetary reshaping characterized by a high viscosity protocore and low viscosity molten silicate and metal [Senshu, H., Kuramoto, K., Matsui, T., 2002. J. Geophys. Res. 107 (E12), 5118. 10.1029/2001JE001819] may result in the transient exposure of the protocore to the planetary surface and a strongly (up to 8\% of the planetary diameter) aspherical deviation of the planetary shape during the early stages of core formation. Exposure of the protocore might happen in the early stages of iron core formation. This process may conceivably convert a large amount of potential energy into temperature increase and a transient strongly non-uniform depth of the magma ocean around the protoplanet. Our simplified model also predicts that the time for metallic core formation out of the metal-rich layer depends mainly on the dynamics of the deformation of the solid strong protocore. In nature this dynamics will be strongly dependent on the effective viscosity of the protocore, which should generally have non-Newtonian pressure-, temperature-, and stress-dependent rheology with strong thermomechanical feedbacks from gravitational energy dissipation.},

  abstract = {A mechanism is proposed to explain the mass loss observed for luminous, hot stars. We show that the ultraviolet resonance lines of ions such as Si iv, C iv, N v, and S vi can give strongly negative effective gravities in the outer parts of the reversing layers of hot stars. We argue that a static reversing layer is then no longer possible and that a continuous outflow of mass occurs. To calculate rates of mass loss resulting from this mechanism, we formulate the problem of steady-state, moving reversing layers. From numerical solutions of the equations of this problem, the rate of mass loss is found to be {$<$} L/c2\textbackslash{} the evolution of the star is therefore not disturbed significantly. The domain in the (log Teiii log g)-plane where the greatest rates of mass loss are expected is also approximately determined and found to be roughly consistent with observation. Finally, the problem of the supersonic flow to large distances from the star is briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic ``dark ages'' to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z {$\approx$} 1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than {$\sim$}1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

Here we report the discovery of a relatively cool, extended, multi-arc dust envelope around the star WR112, most likely formed by wind-wind collision in a long-period binary system. We derive the binary orbital parameters, the dust temperature and the dust mass distributions in the envelope. We find that amorphous carbon is a main constituent of the dust, in agreement with earlier estimates and theoretical predictions. However, the characteristic size of the dust grains is estimated to be {$\sim$} 1\textmu m, significantly larger than theoretical limits. The dust production rate is 6.1 \texttimes{} 10-7M{$\odot$}yr-1 and the total detectable dust mass is found to be about 2.8 \texttimes{} 10-5M{$\odot$} (for d = 4.15 kpc).

The prominent absorption features may arise from a mix of interstellar carbonaceous grains formed in high- (e.g., 3.4, 6.8, 7.2 \textmu m ) and low-temperature (3.3, 6.9, 9.3 \textmu m ) environments. The broad emission complexes around {$\sim$}6.5, 8.0 and 8.8 \textmu m could arise from ionized, small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) clusters and/or amorphous carbonaceous grains. As such these PAH emissions may represent the long sought after precursors of amorphous Carbon dust. We also detect a strong {$\sim$}10.0 \textmu m emission in the spectra of WR48a and WR112, that we tentatively link to ionized PAHs. Upon examining the available archival spectra of prodigious individual WR dust sources, we notice a surprising lack of 7.7 \textmu m PAH band in the spectrum of the binary WR19, in contrast to the apparent strength of the 11.2, 12.7 and 16.4 \textmu m PAH features. Strong PAH emissions are also detected in the {$\lambda$} {$>$}10 \textmu m spectrum of another dust-producing system, WR118, pointing to the presence of large, neutral, presumably interstellar PAH molecules towards WR19 and WR118.},

Detailed study of the phase dependence of the equivalent widths and line profiles of the W-R star reveals significant ionization stratification in the W-R wind. Our previous discussion of the wind-wind collision effects on He I lines is extended to He II lines. We find that (1) the wind-wind collision zone is detached from the surface of the O star; (2) the radiation field of the O star does not inhibit the initial acceleration of the W-R wind; however, it does brake the flow just prior to entrance into the collision zone; (3) the shocked gas experiences rapid, tcool {$<\sptilde$} (2-4) \texttimes{} 104 s, and profound cooling via radiative losses, leading to high compression of the postshock gas.},

Mid-infrared imaging revealed a giant spiral dust plume that is reminiscent of a pinwheel nebula but with additional features that suggest Apep is a unique system. We have conducted observations with the Australian Long Baseline Array to resolve Apep's radio emission on milliarcsecond scales, allowing us to relate the geometry of the wind-collision region to that of the spiral plume. The observed radio emission shows a bow-shaped structure, confirming its origin as a wind-collision region. The shape and orientation of this region is consistent with being originated by the two stars and with being likely dominated by the stronger wind of the WN4\textendash 6b star. This shape allowed us to provide a rough estimation of the opening angle of {$\sim$}150{$\bigcirc$} assuming ideal conditions. The orientation and opening angle of the emission also confirms it as the basis for the spiral dust plume. We also provide estimations for the two stars in the system to milliarcsecond precision. The observed radio emission, one order of magnitude brighter and more luminous than any other known non-thermal radio-emitting CWB, confirms it is produced by an extremely powerful wind collision. Such a powerful wind-collision region is consistent with Apep being a binary composed of two WR stars, so far the first unambiguously confirmed system of its kind.},

Recent observations have indicated that hydrogen-free WR stars have cooler temperatures than those predicted by current evolutionary models. To investigate how varying mass-loss rate affects WR evolution, we have created a grid of pure helium star models. We compare our results with Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud WR observations and show that the temperature ranges of observed WR stars can be reproduced by varying the mass-loss rate, which effectively determines the size of the helium envelope around the core. We also find that WN and WO stars arise from more massive stars, whereas WC stars come from lower masses. This contradicts the standard Conti scenario by which WN and WC stars evolve in an age sequence. We also predict the magnitudes of our models at core-collapse and compare with observations of nearby progenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae. We confirm the findings of previous studies that suggest WR stars are the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae; the progenitors would remain unobserved except in the cases where the progenitor is a low-mass helium giant, as is the case of iPTF13bvn.},

A conception of star formation has emerged in which turbulence plays a dual role, both creating overdensities to initiate gravitational contraction or collapse, and countering the effects of gravity in these overdense regions. The key dynamical processes involved in star formation\textemdash turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity\textemdash are highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star formation, and results from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. We divide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review each in turn. Large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what determines the star formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass function (IMF). Small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systems they beget. We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is increasingly well understood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport in disks. Although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place to build a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the next generation of telescopes.},

  abstract = {Parabolic partial differential equations appear in several physical problems, including problems that have a dominant hyperbolic part coupled to a sub-dominant parabolic component. Explicit methods for their solution are easy to implement but have very restrictive time step constraints. Implicit solution methods can be unconditionally stable but have the disadvantage of being computationally costly or difficult to implement. Super-time-stepping methods for treating parabolic terms in mixed type partial differential equations occupy an intermediate position. In such methods each superstep takes ``s'' explicit Runge-Kutta-like time-steps to advance the parabolic terms by a time-step that is s2 times larger than a single explicit time-step. The expanded stability is usually obtained by mapping the short recursion relation of the explicit Runge-Kutta scheme to the recursion relation of some well-known, stable polynomial. Prior work has built temporally first- and second-order accurate super-time-stepping methods around the recursion relation associated with Chebyshev polynomials. Since their stability is based on the boundedness of the Chebyshev polynomials, these methods have been called RKC1 and RKC2. In this work we build temporally first- and second-order accurate super-time-stepping methods around the recursion relation associated with Legendre polynomials. We call these methods RKL1 and RKL2. The RKL1 method is first-order accurate in time; the RKL2 method is second-order accurate in time. We verify that the newly-designed RKL1 and RKL2 schemes have a very desirable monotonicity preserving property for one-dimensional problems - a solution that is monotone at the beginning of a time step retains that property at the end of that time step. It is shown that RKL1 and RKL2 methods are stable for all values of the diffusion coefficient up to the maximum value. We call this a convex monotonicity preserving property and show by examples that it is very useful in parabolic problems with variable diffusion coefficients. This includes variable coefficient parabolic equations that might give rise to skew symmetric terms. The RKC1 and RKC2 schemes do not share this convex monotonicity preserving property. One-dimensional and two-dimensional von Neumann stability analyses of RKC1, RKC2, RKL1 and RKL2 are also presented, showing that the latter two have some advantages. The paper includes several details to facilitate implementation. A detailed accuracy analysis is presented to show that the methods reach their design accuracies. A stringent set of test problems is also presented. To demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our methods, we show their successful operation on problems involving linear and non-linear heat conduction and viscosity, resistive magnetohydrodynamics, ambipolar diffusion dominated magnetohydrodynamics, level set methods and flux limited radiation diffusion. In a prior paper (Meyer, Balsara and Aslam 2012 [36]) we have also presented an extensive test-suite showing that the RKL2 method works robustly in the presence of shocks in an anisotropically conducting, magnetized plasma.},

  abstract = {Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars represent one of the final stages of massive stellar evolution. Relatively little is known about this short-lived phase and we currently lack reliable mass, distance, and binarity determinations for a representative sample. Here we report the first visual orbit for WR 140 (= HD193793), a WC7+O5 binary system known for its periodic dust production episodes triggered by intense colliding winds near periastron passage. The Infrared-Optical Telescope Array and Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy interferometers resolved the pair of stars in each year from 2003 to 2009, covering most of the highly eccentric, 7.9 year orbit. Combining our results with the recently improved double-line spectroscopic orbit of Fahed et al., we find the WR 140 system is located at a distance of 1.67 {$\pm$} 0.03 kpc, composed of a WR star with M WR = 14.9 {$\pm$} 0.5 M {$\odot$} and an O star with M O = 35.9 {$\pm$} 1.3 M {$\odot$}. Our precision orbit yields key parameters with uncertainties \textasciitilde 6\texttimes{} smaller than previous work and paves the way for detailed modeling of the system. Our newly measured flux ratios at the near-infrared H and Ks bands allow a spectral energy distribution decomposition and analysis of the component evolutionary states.},

The distribution of water in planetary systems is controlled by the temperature structure in the protoplanetary disk and dynamics and migration of planetesimals and planetary embryos. This results in the formation of planetesimals and planetary embryos with a great variety of compositions, water contents and degrees of oxidation. The internal evolution and especially the formation time of planetesimals relative to the timescale of radiogenic heating by short-lived 26Al decay may govern the amount of hydrous silicates and leftover rock\textendash ice mixtures available in the late stages of their evolution. In turn, water content may affect the early internal evolution of the planetesimals and in particular metal-silicate separation processes. Moreover, water content may contribute to an increase of oxygen fugacity and thus affect the concentrations of siderophile elements within the silicate reservoirs of Solar System objects. Finally, the water content strongly influences the differentiation rate of the icy moons, controls their internal evolution and governs the alteration processes occurring in their deep interiors.},

We discuss dust nucleation in stellar atmospheres using published extended atmosphere models, stellar evolution tracks and nucleation conditions. The thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase of intermediate-mass stars is likely to be the most promising site for dust formation in stellar winds. We present an elementary model including dust formation time-scales in which the amount of dust in the interstellar medium is governed by chemical evolution. The implications of the model for high-redshift galaxies are investigated and we show there is no difficulty in producing dusty galaxies at redshifts above 5 if supernovae are a dominant source of interstellar dust. If dust does not condense efficiently in supernovae then significant dust masses can only be generated at z \&gt; 5 by galaxies with a high star formation efficiency. This is consistent with the high star formation rates implied by submillimetre sources found in deep Submillimetre Common User Bolometric Array surveys. We find the visual optical depth for individual star-forming clouds can reach values greater than 1 at very low metallicity (1/100 solar) provided that the mass\textendash radius exponent of molecular clouds is less than 2. Most of the radiation from star formation will emerge at infrared wavelengths in the early Universe provided that dust is present. The (patchy) visual optical depth through a typical early galaxy will, however, remain less than 1 on average until a metallicity of 1/10 solar is reached.},

  abstract = {Surface sputtering by solar-wind ion irradiation of airless planetary  bodies is important for understanding the body's surface and exospheric compositions. Laboratory simulations are both complex and expensive. Hence, theoretical sputtering models are used to describe the behavior of the incoming ions, impacted surface, and sputtered atoms. Results from these models provide inputs for exospheric models. The most common sputter models use the binary collision approximation (BCA), such as SDTrim.SP. While these models are typically accurate for high impact energies, the approximations can potentially introduce error for low energy impacts or crystalline targets. In contrast, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations remove the BCA approximation and are able to simulate the entire collision cascade, albeit at a high computational cost. MD simulations also allow one to control the properties of the initial substrate, including crystalline structure, temperature, crystal damage, and roughness. However, MD simulations can require several user specific choices, such as interatomic potential, that can affect accuracy. Before either BCA or MD models can be confidently used to simulate planetary surface ion impacts, it is important to verify their ranges of applicability and limitations by comparison to pre-existing experimental values. Specifically, we consider a copper substrate impacted by argon ions with kinetic energies between 200-1000 eV and compare the SDTrim.SP and MD results to the experimental values for the resulting sputtering yield and energy distributions. In addition, we compare results with the commonly used Thompson model for the energy distributions. Overall, our findings highlight the potential advantages for MD simulations when specific substrate and simulation parameters are desired.},

Our models incorporate results from previous studies of planetary differentiation and are constrained by petrologic (i.e., grain-size distributions), isotopic (e.g., 207Pb-206Pb and 182Hf-182W ages), and mineralogical properties of differentiated achondrites. We show that formation of a basaltic crust via melt percolation was limited by the formation time of the body, matrix grain size, and viscosity of the melt. We show that low viscosity ({$<$}1 Pa {$\cdot$} s) silicate melt can buoyantly migrate on a time scale comparable to the mean life of 26Al. The equilibrium partitioning of Al into silicate partial melt and the migration of that melt acts to dampen internal temperatures. However, subsequent heating from the decay of 60Fe generated melt fractions in excess of 50\%, thus completing differentiation for bodies that accreted within 2 Myr of CAI formation (i.e., the onset of isotopic decay). Migration and concentration of 26Al into a crust results in remelting of that crust for accretion times less than 2 Myr and for bodies {$>$}100 km in size. Differentiation would be most likely for planetesimals larger than 20 km in diameter that accreted within approximately 2.7 Myr of CAI formation.},

After a brief overview of theoretical models and main open issues, we present observational searches for the evolutionary phases of high-mass star formation, first among high-luminosity sources and more recently among young massive protostars and the elusive high-mass prestellar cores. We then introduce the most likely evolutionary scenario for high-mass star formation, which emphasizes the link of high-mass star formation to massive cloud and cluster formation. Finally, we introduce the first attempts to search for variations of the star-formation activity and cluster formation in molecular cloud complexes in the most extreme star-forming sites and across the Milky Way. The combination of Galactic plane surveys and high\textendash angular resolution images with submillimeter facilities such as Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) are prerequisites to make significant progress in the forthcoming decade.},

  abstract = {Context. Mass loss from massive stars forms an important aspect of the evolution of massive stars, as well as for the enrichment of the surrounding interstellar medium. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: Our goal is to predict accurate mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities. These quantities can be compared to empirical values, thereby testing radiation-driven wind models. One specific topical issue is that of the so-called "weak-wind problem", where empirically derived mass-loss rates and (modified) wind momenta fall orders of magnitude short of predicted values. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We employ an established Monte Carlo model and a recently suggested new line acceleration formalism to solve the wind dynamics more consistently. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We provide a new grid of mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities of O-type stars, and compare the values to empirical results. Our models fail to provide mass-loss rates for main-sequence stars below a luminosity of log(L/L\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}) = 5.2, where we appear to run into a fundamental limit. At luminosities below this critical value there is insufficient momentum transferred to the wind in the region below the sonic point in order to kick-start the acceleration of the flow. This problem occurs at almost the exact location of the onset of the weak-wind problem. For O dwarfs, the boundary between being able to start a wind, and failing to do so, is at spectral type O6/O6.5. The direct cause of this failure for O6.5 stars is a combination of the lower luminosity and a lack of Fe v lines at the base of the wind. This might indicate that - in addition to radiation pressure - another mechanism is required to provide the necessary driving to initiate the wind acceleration. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: For stars more luminous than 10\textsuperscript{5.2} L\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}, our new mass-loss rates are in excellent agreement with the mass-loss prescription by Vink et al. (2000, A\&amp;A, 362, 295) using our terminal wind velocities as input to this recipe. This implies that the main assumption entering the method of the Vink et al. prescriptions - i.e. that the momentum equation is not explicitly solved for - does not compromise the reliability of the Vink et al. results for this part of parameter space. Finally, our new models predict terminal velocities that are typically 35 and 45 percent larger than observed values. Such over-predictions are similar to those from (modified) CAK-theory.},

  abstract = {We present DART-RAY, a new ray-tracing 3D dust radiative transfer (RT) code designed specifically to calculate radiation field energy density (RFED) distributions within dusty galaxy models with arbitrary geometries. In this paper we introduce the basic algorithm implemented in DART-RAY which is based on a pre-calculation of a lower limit for the RFED distribution. This pre-calculation allows us to estimate the extent of regions around the radiation sources within which these sources contribute significantly to the RFED. In this way, ray-tracing calculations can be restricted to take place only within these regions, thus substantially reducing the computational time compared to a complete ray-tracing RT calculation. Anisotropic scattering is included in the code and handled in a similar fashion. Furthermore, the code utilizes a Cartesian adaptive spatial grid and an iterative method has been implemented to optimize the angular densities of the rays originated from each emitting cell. In order to verify the accuracy of the RT calculations performed by DART-RAY, we present results of comparisons with solutions obtained using the DUSTY 1D RT code for a dust shell illuminated by a central point source and existing 2D RT calculations of disc galaxies with diffusely distributed stellar emission and dust opacity. Finally, we show the application of the code on a spiral galaxy model with logarithmic spiral arms in order to measure the effect of the spiral pattern on the attenuation and RFED.},

The new version includes five major upgrades: 1) a series of optimizations for the ray-angular density and the scattered radiation source function; 2) the implementation of several data and task parallelizations using hybrid MPI+OpenMP schemes; 3) the inclusion of dust selfheating; 4) the ability to produce surface brightness maps for observers within the models in HEALPix format; 5) the possibility to set the expected numerical accuracy already at the start of the calculation. We tested the updated code with benchmark models where the dust self-heating is not negligible. Furthermore, we performed a study of the extent of the source influence volumes, using galaxy models, which are critical in determining the efficiency of the DART-Ray algorithm. The new code is publicly available, documented for both users and developers, and accompanied by several programmes to create input grids for different model geometries and to import the results of N-body and SPH simulations. These programmes can be easily adapted to different input geometries, and for different dust models or stellar emission libraries.},

  abstract = {We report on the first detection of a global change in the X-ray emitting properties of a wind\textendash wind collision, thanks to XMM-Newton observations of the massive Small Magellenic Cloud (SMC) system HD 5980. While its light curve had remained unchanged between 2000 and 2005, the X-ray flux has now increased by a factor of {$\sim$}2.5, and slightly hardened. The new observations also extend the observational coverage over the entire orbit, pinpointing the light-curve shape. It has not varied much despite the large overall brightening, and a tight correlation of fluxes with orbital separation is found without any hysteresis effect. Moreover, the absence of eclipses and of absorption effects related to orientation suggests a large size for the X-ray emitting region. Simple analytical models of the wind\textendash wind collision, considering the varying wind properties of the eruptive component in HD 5980, are able to reproduce the recent hardening and the flux-separation relationship, at least qualitatively, but they predict a hardening at apastron and little change in mean flux, contrary to observations. The brightness change could then possibly be related to a recently theorized phenomenon linked to the varying strength of thin-shell instabilities in shocked wind regions.},

We complemented these observations with Swift and Chandra data sets, allowing for the study of two additional systems. We also improved the ephemerides, for these systems displaying photometric changes, using TESS, Kepler, and ASAS-SN data. Five systems displayed a very faint X-ray emission (log [LX/LBOL] {$<$} -8) and three a faint one (log [LX/LBOL] {$\sim$} -7), incompatible with typical colliding wind emission: not all WR (Wolf-Rayet) binaries are thus X-ray bright. In a few other systems, X-rays from the O-star companion cannot be excluded as being the true source of X-rays (or a large contributor). In two additional cases, the emission appears faint but the observations were taken with the WR wind obscuring the line of sight, which could hide a colliding wind emission. Clear evidence of colliding winds was however found in the remaining six systems (WR 19, 21, 31, 97, 105, and 127). In WR 19, a large absorption and larger emission at periastron are even detected, in line with expectations of adiabatic collisions.},

Using an escape probability method to solve for the molecular level populations, we have obtained the cooling rate for each molecule as a function of temperature, density, and an optical depth parameter. A four-parameter expression proves useful in fitting the run of cooling rate with density for any fixed values of the temperature and optical depth parameter. We identify the various cooling mechanisms which are dominant in different regions of the astrophysically relevant parameter space. Given the assumption that water is very abundant in warm regions of the interstellar medium, H2O rotational transitions are found to dominate the cooling of warm interstellar gas over a wide portion of the parameter space considered. While chemical models for the interstellar medium make the strong prediction that water will be produced copiously at temperatures above a few hundred degrees, our assumption of a high water abundance has yet to be tested observationally. The Infrared Space Observatory and the Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite will prove ideal instruments for testing whether water is indeed an important coolant of interstellar and circumstellar gas.},

  abstract = {The presence and abundance of short-lived radioisotopes 26Al and 60Fe in chondritic meteorites implies that the Sun formed in the vicinity of one or more massive stars that exploded as supernovae (SNe). Massive stars are more likely to form in massive star clusters ({$>$}1000 M{$\odot$}) than lower mass clusters. However, photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs from massive stars and dynamical interactions with passing stars can inhibit planet formation in clusters with radii of {$\sim$}1 pc. We investigate whether low-mass (50-200 M{$\odot$}) star clusters containing one or two massive stars are a more likely avenue for early Solar system enrichment as they are more dynamically quiescent. We analyse N-body simulations of the evolution of these low-mass clusters and find that a similar fraction of stars experience SN enrichment than in high-mass clusters, despite their lower densities. This is due to two-body relaxation, which causes a significant expansion before the first SN even in clusters with relatively low (100 stars pc-3) initial densities. However, because of the high number of low-mass clusters containing one or two massive stars, the absolute number of enriched stars is the same, if not higher than for more populous clusters. Our results show that direct enrichment of protoplanetary discs from SNe occurs as frequently in low-mass clusters containing one or two massive stars ({$>$}20 M{$\odot$}) as in more populous star clusters (1000 M{$\odot$}). This relaxes the constraints on the direct enrichment scenario and therefore the birth environment of the Solar system.},

  abstract = {New terminal wind velocities for 164 Wolf-Rayet stars (from the Galaxy and LMC) based on PCyg profiles of lambda1550 CIV resonance line were derived from the archive high and low resolution IUE spectra available form the INES database. The high resolution data on 59 WR stars (39 from the Galaxy and 20 from LMC) were used to calibrate the empirical relation lambda\_min\^Abs- lambda\_peak\^Emis vs terminal wind velocity, which was then used for determinations of the terminal wind velocities from the low resolution IUE data. We almost doubled the previous most extended sample of such measurements. Our new measurements, based on high resolution data, are precise within 5-7\%. Measurements, based on the low resolution spectra have the formal errors of approx 40-60\%. A comparison of the present results with other determinations suggests higher precision of approx 20\%. We found that the terminal wind velocities for the Galactic WC and WN stars correlate with the WR spectral subtype. We also found that the LMC WN stars have winds slower than their Galactic counterparts, up to two times in the case of the WNE stars. No influence of binarity on terminal wind velocities was found. Our extended set of measurements allowed us to test application of the radiation driven wind theory to the WR stars. We found that, contrary to OB stars, terminal wind velocities of the WR stars correlate only weakly with stellar temperature. We also note that the terminal to escape velocity ratio for the WR stars is relatively low: 2.55 pm 1.14 for the Galactic WN stars and 1.78 pm 0.70 for the Galactic WCs. This ratio decreases with temperature of WR stars, contrary to what is observed in the case of OB stars. The presented results show complex influence of chemical composition on the WR winds driving mechanism efficiency. Our kinematical data on WR winds suggest evolutionary sequence: WNL --{$>$} WNE --{$>$} WCE --{$>$} WCL.},

  abstract = {We present infrared (IR) photometry of the WC9+B0I Wolf-Rayet binary system HD 137603 (WR 70) observed with telescopes at the European Southern Observatory, the South African Astronomical Observatory and the Anglo-Australian Telescope between 1983 and 2010 which shows persistent but variable circumstellar dust emission. Optical spectroscopy confirms the classification of the companion as a B0 supergiant and suggests that the Balmer lines in its spectrum suffer in-fill from wind emission. Re-examination of the reddening suggests a revised distance of 3.5 kpc. In the near-IR, the amplitude of variation increases with wavelength, with no significant variation in J (nor is there in the visible), implying that it is the amount of dust in the wind of WR 70 that is varying. Period searches show a period near 2.82 yr (1030 d) but the variations are not strictly regular and there are other factors affecting the dust formation and repeatability of the light curves. There may be a secondary period near 5.88 yr but there is no evidence for periods less than a year. A model of the spectral energy distribution in 1991 gives a dust formation rate of 5.9 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{-7} M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} yr\textsuperscript{-1}, around one-third of the available carbon from the WC9 wind going into the wind-collision region, estimating its size from average WC9 and B0Ia wind properties. The fraction of carbon going into dust varied between \texttildelow 11 and 46 per cent during our campaign, possibly as a consequence of the stars moving in an elliptical orbit.},

  abstract = {I review driving mechanisms for stellar winds, using first the example of the coronal, pressure-driven solar wind, but then focussing mainly on radiation-pressure driven winds from hot, luminous stars. For the latter, I review the central role of line-opacity as a coupling between matter and radiation, emphasizing how the Doppler shift of an accelerating wind outflow exposes the strong line opacity to a substantial continuum flux, and thus allows the line force to sustain the outward acceleration against gravity. Through the CAK formalism that assumes a power-law distribution of line-opacity, I derive the mass loss rate and wind velocity law, and discuss how these are altered by various refinements like a finite-disk correction, ionization variations in opacity, and a non-zero sound speed. I also discuss how multiline scattering in Wolf-Rayet (WR) winds can allow them to exceed the single scattering limit, for which the wind and radiative momenta are equal. Through a time-dependent perturbation analysis, I show how the line-driving leads to a fast, inward ``Abbott-wave'' mode for long wavelength perturbations, and a strong Line-Deshadowing-Instability at short wavelengths, summarizing also 1D and 2D numerical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of this instability. I next discuss how rapid stellar rotation alters the latitudinal variation of mass loss and flow speed, and how this depends on treatment of gravity darkening, nonradial line forces, and ``bi-stability'' shifts in ionization. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of the large mass loss epochs of Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars, and how these might be modeled via superEddington, continuum driving moderated by the ``porosity'' associated with extensive spatial structure.},

We study the impacts on the yields of a change of initial mass, metallicity and initial rotation velocity. We also consider the effects of a change of mass loss rates during the Wolf-Rayet phase. We show that for surface rotation velocities during the core H-burning phase matching to the observed ones, the quantity of ejected by a star of a given initial mass and metallicity is roughly doubled when the effects of rotation are taken into account. The metallicity dependence of the yield is, on the other hand, very similar to that obtained from non-rotating models.

  abstract = {Star and planet formation are inextricably linked. In the earliest phases of the collapse of a protostar, a disc forms around the young star and such discs are observed for the first several million years of a star's life. It is within these circumstellar, or protoplanetary, discs that the first stages of planet formation occur. Recent observations from the Atacama large millimetre array (ALMA) suggest that planet formation may already be underway after only 1 Myr of a star's life. However, stars do not form in isolation; they form from the collapse and fragmentation of giant molecular clouds several parsecs in size. This results in young stars forming in groups\textemdash often referred to as `clusters'. In these star-forming regions, the stellar density is much higher than the location of the Sun and other stars in the Galactic disc that host exoplanets. As such, the environment where stars form has the potential to influence the planet formation process. In star-forming regions, protoplanetary discs can be truncated or destroyed by interactions with passing stars, as well as photoevaporation from the radiation fields of very massive stars. Once formed, the planets themselves can have their orbits altered by dynamical encounters\textemdash either directly from passing stars or through secondary effects such as the Kozai\textendash Lidov mechanism. In this contribution, I review the different processes that can affect planet formation and stability in star-forming regions. I discuss each process in light of the typical range of stellar densities observed for star-forming regions. I finish by discussing these effects in the context of theories for the birth environment of the Solar System.},

These initial conditions were also derived from a separate analysis of the runaway and walkaway stars in the region, and indicate that star-forming regions within 1 kpc of the Sun likely have a broad range of initial stellar densities. In the case of NGC 2264, its initial stellar density could have been high enough to cause the destruction or truncation of protoplanetary discs and fledgling planetary systems due to dynamical encounters between stars in the early stages of its evolution.},

  abstract = {The presence and abundance of the short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs) 26Al and 60Fe during the formation of the Solar system is difficult to explain unless the Sun formed in the vicinity of one or more massive star(s) that exploded as supernovae. Two different scenarios have been proposed to explain the delivery of SLRs to the protosolar nebula: (I) direct pollution of the protosolar disc by supernova ejecta, and (II) the formation of the Sun in a sequential star formation event in which supernovae shockwaves trigger further star formation which is enriched in SLRs. The sequentially triggered model has been suggested as being more astrophysically likely than the direct pollution scenario. In this paper, we investigate this claim by analysing a combination of N-body and smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of star formation. We find that sequential star formation would result in large age spreads (or even bi-modal age distributions for spatially coincident events) due to the dynamical relaxation of the first star formation event(s). Secondly, we discuss the probability of triggering spatially and temporally discrete populations of stars and find this to be only possible in very contrived situations. Taken together, these results suggest that the formation of the Solar system in a triggered star formation event is as improbable, if not more so, than the direct pollution of the protosolar disc by a supernova.},

We cover a range of star cluster formation parameter space and model both clusters with primordial substructure and those with smooth profiles. We also adopt different initial virial ratios - from cool, collapsing clusters to warm, expanding associations. In each cluster, we place the same stellar population; the clusters each have 2100 stars and contain one massive 25 M{$\odot$} star which is expected to explode as a supernova at about 6.6 Myr. We determine the number of solar (G)-type stars that are within 0.1-0.3 pc of the 25 M{$\odot$} star at the time of the supernova, which is the distance required to enrich the protoplanetary disc with the 26Al abundances found in meteorites. We then determine how many of these G-dwarfs are unperturbed `singletons'; stars which are never in close binaries, nor suffer sub-100 au encounters, and which also do not suffer strong dynamical perturbations. The evolution of a suite of 20 initially identical clusters is highly stochastic, with the supernova enriching over 10 G-dwarfs in some clusters, and none at all in others. Typically, only {$\sim$}25 per cent of clusters contain enriched, unperturbed singletons, and usually only one to two per cluster (from a total of 96 G-dwarfs in each cluster). The initial conditions for star formation do not strongly affect the results, although a higher fraction of supervirial (expanding) clusters would contain enriched G-dwarfs if the supernova occurred earlier than 6.6 Myr. If we sum together simulations with identical initial conditions, then {$\sim$}1 per cent of all G-dwarfs in our simulations are enriched, unperturbed singletons.},

  abstract = {Methods. Three dimensional (3D) adaptive-mesh refinement (AMR) simulations are presented that include radiative driving, gravity, optically-thin radiative cooling, and orbital motion. Simulations were performed with instantaneously accelerated and radiatively driven stellar winds. Radiative transfer calculations were performed on the simulation output to generate synthetic X-ray data, which are used to conduct a detailed comparison against observations. Results. When instantaneously accelerated stellar winds are adopted in the simulation, a stable wind-wind collision region (WCR) is established at all orbital phases. In contrast, when the stellar winds are radiatively driven, and thus the acceleration regions of the winds are accounted for, the WCR is far more unstable. As the stars approach periastron, the ram pressure of the WR's wind overwhelms the O star's and, following a significant disruption of the shocks by non-linear thin-shell instabilities (NTSIs), the WCR collapses onto the O star. X-ray calculations reveal that when a stable WCR exists the models over-predict the observed X-ray flux by more than two orders of magnitude. The collapse of the WCR onto the O star substantially reduces the discrepancy in the 2\textendash 10 keV flux to a factor of 6 at {$\varphi$} = 0.994. However, the observed spectrum is not well matched by the models. Conclusions. We conclude that the agreement between the models and observations could be improved by increasing the ratio of the mass-loss rates in favour of the WR star to the extent that a normal wind ram pressure balance does not occur at any orbital phase, potentially leading to a sustained collapse of the WCR onto the O star. Radiative braking may then play a significant r\^ole for the WCR dynamics and resulting X-ray emission.},

  abstract = {How can the drag coefficient of a car be reduced? What factors govern the variation in the shape of the Earth's magnetosphere? What is the basis of weather prediction? These are examples of problems that can only be tackled with a sound knowledge of the principles and methods of fluid dynamics. This important discipline has applications which range from the study of the large-scale properties of the galaxies to the design of high precision engineering components. This book introduces the subject of fluid dynamics from the first principles. The first eleven chapters cover all the basic ideas of fluid mechanics, explaining carefully the modelling and mathematics needed. The last six chapters illustrate applications of this material to linearised sound and water waves, to high speed flow of air, to non-linear water waves on channels, and to aerofoil theory. Over 350 diagrams have been used to illustrate key points. Exercises are included to help develop and reinforce the reader's understanding of the material presented. References at the ends of each chapter serve not only to guide readers to more detailed texts, but also list where alternative descriptions of the salient points in the chapter may be found. This book is an undergraduate text for second or third year students of mathematics or mathematical physics, who are taking a first course in fluid dynamics.},

  abstract = {The population of planets smaller than approximately 1.7\,Earth radii (R{$\oplus$}) is widely interpreted as consisting of rocky worlds, generally referred to as super-Earths. This picture is largely corroborated by radial velocity mass measurements for close-in super-Earths but lacks constraints at lower insolations. Here we present the results of a detailed study of the Kepler-138 system using 13 Hubble and Spitzer transit observations of the warm-temperate 1.51\,{$\pm$}\,0.04\,R{$\oplus$} planet Kepler-138 d (\$\$\{T\}\_\{\textbackslash rm\{eq,A\_\{\textbackslash rm\{B\}\} = 0.3\}\}\textbackslash approx 350\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash mathrm\{K\}\}\$\$) combined with new radial velocity measurements of its host star obtained with the Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. We find evidence for a volatile-rich `water world' nature of Kepler-138 d, with a large fraction of its mass \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm\{d\}\}\$ contained in a thick volatile layer. This finding is independently supported by transit timing variations and radial velocity observations (\$\$\{M\}\_\{\{\{\{\textbackslash rm\{d\}\}\}\}\}=2.\{1\}\_\{-0.7\}\^\{+0.6\}\textbackslash,\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash oplus \}\$\$), as well as the flat optical/infrared transmission spectrum. Quantitatively, we infer a composition of \$\$1\{1\}\_\{-4\}\^\{+3\}\textbackslash\%\$\$volatiles by mass or \textasciitilde 51\% by volume, with a 2,000-km-deep water mantle and atmosphere on top of a core with an Earth-like silicates/iron ratio. Any hypothetical hydrogen layer consistent with the observations ({$<$}0.003\,M{$\oplus$}) would have swiftly been lost on a \textasciitilde 10\,Myr timescale. The bulk composition of Kepler-138 d therefore resembles those of the icy moons, rather than the terrestrial planets, in the Solar System. We conclude that not all super-Earths are rocky worlds, but that volatile-rich water worlds exist in an overlapping size regime, especially at lower insolations. Finally, our photodynamical analysis also reveals that Kepler-138 c (with a Rc\,=\,1.51\,{$\pm$}\,0.04\,R{$\oplus$} and a \$\$\{M\}\_\{\{\{\{\textbackslash rm\{c\}\}\}\}\}=2.\{3\}\_\{-0.5\}\^\{+0.6\}\textbackslash,\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash oplus \}\$\$) is a slightly warmer twin of Kepler-138 d (that is, another water world in the same system) and we infer the presence of Kepler-138 e, a likely non-transiting planet at the inner edge of the habitable zone.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of the wind\textendash wind collision in massive stellar binaries are investigated using 3D hydrodynamical models which incorporate gravity, the driving of the winds, the orbital motion of the stars and radiative cooling of the shocked plasma. In this first paper, we restrict our study to main-sequence O+O binaries. The nature of the wind\textendash wind collision region is highly dependent on the degree of cooling of the shocked plasma, and the ratio of the flow time-scale of the shocked plasma to the orbital time-scale. The pre-shock wind speeds are lower in close systems as the winds collide prior to their acceleration to terminal speeds. Radiative inhibition may also reduce the pre-shock wind speeds. Together, these effects can lead to rapid cooling of the post-shock gas. Radiative inhibition is less important in wider systems, where the winds are accelerated to higher speeds before they collide, and the resulting collision region can be largely adiabatic. In systems with eccentric orbits, cold gas formed during periastron passage can persist even at apastron, before being ablated and mixed into its surroundings and/or accelerated out of the system.},

The emission is calculated from 3D hydrodynamical models which incorporate gravity, the driving of the winds, orbital motion of the stars and radiative cooling of the shocked plasma. Changes in the amount of stellar occultation and circumstellar attenuation introduce phase-dependent X-ray variability in systems with circular orbits, while strong variations in the intrinsic emission also occur in systems with eccentric orbits. The X-ray emission in eccentric systems can display strong hysteresis, with the emission softer after periastron than at corresponding orbital phases prior to periastron, reflecting the physical state of the shocked plasma at these times.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the thermal emission over cm to submillimetre (submm) wavelengths from the winds in short-period O + O star binaries is investigated (potential non-thermal emission is presently ignored). The calculations are based on 3D hydrodynamical models which incorporate gravity, the driving of the winds, orbital motion of the stars and radiative cooling of the shocked plasma. The thermal emission arises from the stellar winds and the region where they collide. We investigate the flux and spectrum from a variety of models as a function of orbital phase and orientation of the observer, and compare to the single star case. The emission from the wind\textendash wind collision region (WCR) is strongly dependent on its density and temperature, being optically thick in radiative systems and optically thin in adiabatic systems. The flux from systems where the WCR is highly radiative, as investigated for the first time in this paper, can be over an order of magnitude greater than the combined flux from identically typed single stars. This excess occurs over a broad range of wavelengths from cm to submm. In contrast, when the WCR is largely adiabatic, a significant excess in the thermal flux occurs only below 100 GHz.},

Our calculations are for orbital phase 0.837 when the observed radio emission is close to maximum. Using the observed thermal X-ray emission at this phase in conjunction with the radio emission to constrain the mass-loss rates, we find that the O star mass-loss rate is consistent with the reduced estimates for O4-5 supergiants by Fullerton, Massa \& Prinja, and the wind-momentum ratio, {$\eta$} = 0.02. This is independent of the opening angle deduced from radio very long baseline interferometry observations of the WCR that we demonstrate fail to constrain the opening angle.},

  abstract = {The long-period, highly eccentric Wolf-Rayet star binary system WR 140 has exceptionally well-determined orbital and stellar parameters. Bright, variable X-ray emission is generated in shocks produced by the collision of the winds of the WC7pd+O5.5fc component stars. We discuss the variations in the context of the colliding-wind model using broadband spectrometry from the RXTE, Swift, and NICER observatories obtained over 20 yr and nearly 1000 observations through three consecutive 7.94 yr orbits, including three periastron passages. The X-ray luminosity varies as expected with the inverse of the stellar separation over most of the orbit; departures near periastron are produced when cooling shifts to excess optical emission in C III {$\lambda$}5696 in particular. We use X-ray absorption to estimate mass-loss rates for both stars and to constrain the system morphology. The absorption maximum coincides closely with the inferior conjunction of the WC star and provides evidence of the ion-reflection mechanism that underlies the formation of collisionless shocks governed by magnetic fields probably generated by the Weibel instability. Comparisons with K-band emission and He I {$\lambda$}10830 absorption show that both are correlated after periastron with the asymmetric X-ray absorption. Dust appears within a few days of periastron, suggesting formation within shocked gas near the stagnation point. The X-ray flares seen in {$\eta$} Car have not occurred in WR 140, suggesting the absence of large-scale wind inhomogeneities. Relatively constant soft emission revealed during the X-ray minimum is probably not from recombining plasma entrained in outflowing shocked gas.},

MUSE facilitates the coupling of existing codes written in different languages by providing inter-language tools and by specifying an interface between each module and the framework that represents a balance between generality and computational efficiency. This approach allows scientists to use combinations of codes to solve highly coupled problems without the need to write new codes for other domains or significantly alter their existing codes. MUSE currently incorporates the domains of stellar dynamics, stellar evolution and stellar hydrodynamics for studying generalized stellar systems. We have now reached a "Noah's Ark" milestone, with (at least) two available numerical solvers for each domain. MUSE can treat multiscale and multiphysics systems in which the time- and size-scales are well separated, like simulating the evolution of planetary systems, small stellar associations, dense stellar clusters, galaxies and galactic nuclei. In this paper we describe three examples calculated using MUSE: the merger of two galaxies, the merger of two evolving stars, and a hybrid N-body simulation. In addition, we demonstrate an implementation of MUSE on a distributed computer which may also include special-purpose hardware, such as GRAPEs or GPUs, to accelerate computations. The current MUSE code base is publicly available as open source at http://muse.li.},

The framework can be efficiently implemented and incurs an acceptable overhead. In practice, we measure the time spent in the framework to be less than 1\% of the wall-clock time. Due to the unified structure of the interface, incorporating multiple modules addressing the same physics in different ways is relatively straightforward. Different modules may be advanced serially or in parallel. Despite initial concerns, we have encountered relatively few problems with this strict separation between modules, and the results of our simulations are consistent with earlier results using more traditional monolithic approaches. This framework provides a platform to combine existing simulation codes or develop new physical solver codes within a rich ``ecosystem'' of interchangeable modules.},

To illustrate the model, we apply it to the formation of neutron stars, both single and in binaries. The eccentricity of primordial binaries allows a wide, non-interacting binary to survive the first and second supernovae in many more cases than suggested by previous calculations that assume circular orbits. Mass transfer in binaries enhances the rate of type I supernovae with respect to that of the type II supernovae. A sizable fraction of initial binaries merge into a single star; 10-15\% of the type II supernovae are from such mergers. Models in which neutron stars receive a kick velocity at birth predict birth rates for wide and close radio-pulsar binaries, and for high-mass (including Be-) X-ray binaries that are roughly in agreement with observations. All our models produce too many Her X-1 type binaries. The formation rate of radio-pulsars that remain in a binary after the first supernova explosion and are released at the second supernova event is predicted by our models to be comparable to the formation rate of recycled binary radio pulsars, i.e. less than a few per cent of the formation rate of single radio pulsars.},

We highlight recent developments in terms of physics modules such as hydrodynamics with dust coupling and the conservative implementation of Hall magnetohydrodynamics. A simple conservative high-order finite difference scheme that works in combination with all available physics modules is introduced and demonstrated at the example of monotonicity preserving fifth order reconstruction. Strong stability preserving high order Runge-Kutta time steppers are used to obtain stable evolutions in multi-dimensional applications realizing up to fourth order accuracy in space and time. With the new distinction between active and passive grid cells, MPI-AMRVAC is ideally suited to simulate evolutions where parts of the solution are controlled analytically, or have a tendency to progress into or out of a stationary state. Typical test problems and representative applications are discussed, with an outlook to follow-up research. Finally, we discuss the parallel scaling of the code and demonstrate excellent weak scaling up to 30 000 processors allowing to exploit modern peta-scale infrastructure.},

This greatly expanded third edition of Numerical Recipes has it, with wider coverage than ever before, many new, expanded and updated sections, and two completely new chapters. The executable C++ code, now printed in colour for easy reading, adopts an object-oriented style particularly suited to scientific applications. Co-authored by four leading scientists from academia and industry, Numerical Recipes starts with basic mathematics and computer science and proceeds to complete, working routines. The whole book is presented in the informal, easy-to-read style that made earlier editions so popular. Highlights of the new material include: a new chapter on classification and inference, Gaussian mixture models, HMMs, hierarchical clustering, and SVMs; a new chapter on computational geometry, covering KD trees, quad- and octrees, Delaunay triangulation, and algorithms for lines, polygons, triangles, and spheres; interior point methods for linear programming; MCMC; an expanded treatment of ODEs with completely new routines; and many new statistical distributions.

  abstract = {Dust-gas mixtures are the simplest example of a two fluid mixture. We show that when simulating such mixtures with particles or with particles coupled to grids a problem arises due to the need to resolve a very small length scale when the coupling is strong. Since this is occurs in the limit when the fluids are well coupled, we show how the dust-gas equations can be reformulated to describe a single fluid mixture. The equations are similar to the usual fluid equations supplemented by a diffusion equation for the dust-to-gas ratio or alternatively the dust fraction. This solves a number of numerical problems as well as making the physics clear.},

  abstract = {Mass loss is a key process in the evolution of massive stars, and must be understood quantitatively if it is to be successfully included in broader astrophysical applications such as galactic and cosmic evolution and ionization. In this review, we discuss various aspects of radiation driven mass loss, both from the theoretical and the observational side. We focus on developments in the past decade, concentrating on the winds from OB-stars, with some excursions to the winds from Luminous Blue Variables (including super-Eddington, continuum-driven winds), winds from Wolf\textendash Rayet stars, A-supergiants and Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae. After recapitulating the 1-D, stationary standard model of line-driven winds, extensions accounting for rotation and magnetic fields are discussed. Stationary wind models are presented that provide theoretical predictions for the mass-loss rates as a function of spectral type, metallicity, and the proximity to the Eddington limit. The relevance of the so-called bi-stability jump is outlined. We summarize diagnostical methods to infer wind properties from observations, and compare the results from corresponding campaigns (including the VLT-flames survey of massive stars) with theoretical predictions, featuring the mass loss-metallicity dependence. Subsequently, we concentrate on two urgent problems, weak winds and wind-clumping, that have been identified from various diagnostics and that challenge our present understanding of radiation driven winds. We discuss the problems of ``measuring'' mass-loss rates from weak winds and the potential of the NIR Br{$\alpha$}-line as a tool to enable a more precise quantification, and comment on physical explanations for mass-loss rates that are much lower than predicted by the standard model. Wind-clumping, conventionally interpreted as the consequence of a strong instability inherent to radiative line-driving, has severe implications for the interpretation of observational diagnostics, since derived mass-loss rates are usually overestimated when clumping is present but ignored in the analyses. Depending on the specific diagnostics, such overestimates can amount to factors of 2 to 10, and we describe ongoing attempts to allow for more uniform results. We point out that independent arguments from stellar evolution favor a moderate reduction of present-day mass-loss rates. We also consider larger scale wind structure, interpreted in terms of co-rotating interacting regions, and complete this review with a discussion of recent progress on the X-ray line emission from massive stars. Such emission is thought to originate both from magnetically confined winds and from non-magnetic winds, in the latter case related to the line-driven instability and/or clump-clump collisions. We highlight as to how far the analysis of such X-ray line emission can give further clues regarding an adequate description of wind clumping.},

  abstract = {Most types of massive stars display X-ray emission that is affected by the properties of their stellar winds. Single non-magnetic OB stars have an X-ray luminosity that scales with their bolometric luminosity and their emission is thought to arise from a distribution of wind-embedded shocks. The lack of significant short-term stochastic variability indicates that the winds consist of a large number of independent fragments. Detailed variability studies unveiled a connection between the photosphere and the wind: well-studied O-type stars exhibit a \textasciitilde{} 10\% modulation of their emission on timescales consistent with the rotation period, and a few early B-type pulsators display \textasciitilde{} 10\% modulations of their X-ray flux with the pulsation period. Unlike OB stars, their evolved descendants (WR and LBV stars) lack a well-defined relation between their X-ray and bolometric luminosities, and several subcategories of objects remain undetected. These properties most likely stem from the combined effects of wind optical depth and wind velocity. Magnetic OB stars display an enhanced X-ray emission frequently modulated by the rotation of the star. These properties are well explained by the magnetically confined wind shock model and an oblique magnetic rotator configuration. Some massive binaries display phase-dependent excess emission arising from the collision between the winds of the binary components. Yet, the majority of the massive binaries do not show such an emission, probably as a consequence of radiative cooling of the shock-heated plasma. Finally, a growing subset of the Be stars, the so-called gamma Cas stars, feature an unusually hard and strong thermal X-ray emission that varies over a wide range of timescales. Several scenarios have been proposed to explain these properties, but the origin of the phenomenon remains currently one of the major unsolved puzzles in stellar X-ray astrophysics.},

  abstract = {Photometric detections of dust circumstellar discs around pre-main sequence (PMS) stars, coupled with estimates of stellar ages, provide constraints on the time available for planet formation. Most previous studies on disc longevity, starting with Haisch, Lada \& Lada, use star samples from PMS clusters but do not consider data sets with homogeneous photometric sensitivities and/or ages placed on a uniform time-scale. Here we conduct the largest study to date of the longevity of inner dust discs using X-ray and 1-8 \textmu m infrared photometry from the MYStIX and SFiNCs projects for 69 young clusters in 32 nearby star-forming regions with ages t {$\leq$} 5 Myr. Cluster ages are derived by combining the empirical AgeJX method with PMS evolutionary models, which treat dynamo-generated magnetic fields in different ways. Leveraging X-ray data to identify disc-free objects, we impose similar stellar mass sensitivity limits for disc-bearing and disc-free young stellar objects while extending the analysis to stellar masses as low as M {$\sim$} 0.1 M{$\odot$}. We find that the disc longevity estimates are strongly affected by the choice of PMS evolutionary model. Assuming a disc fraction of 100 per cent at zero age, the inferred disc half-life changes significantly, from t1/2 {$\sim$} 1.3-2 Myr to t1/2 {$\sim$} 3.5 Myr when switching from non-magnetic to magnetic PMS models. In addition, we find no statistically significant evidence that disc fraction varies with stellar mass within the first few Myr of life for stars with masses {$<$}2 M{$\odot$}, but our samples may not be complete for more massive stars. The effects of initial disc fraction and star-forming environment are also explored.},

Hyperion is parallelized, and is shown to scale well to thousands of processes. Two common benchmark models for protoplanetary disks were computed, and the results are found to be in excellent agreement with those from other codes. Finally, to demonstrate the capabilities of the code, dust temperatures, SEDs, and synthetic multi-wavelength images were computed for a dynamical simulation of a low-mass star formation region.

  abstract = {Wolf\textendash Rayet (WR) stars are evolved massive stars, presumably on their way to becoming supernovae. They are characterized by high luminosities and fast and dense stellar winds. We have detected signs of a radio continuum pinwheel associated with WR 147, a nitrogen-rich WR star with spectral subtype WN8. These structures are known to exist around a handful of late-type carbon-rich WR stars with massive companions where dust has formed in the zone where the two winds collide and produced a plume of dense gas and dust that is carried out with the WR wind. As the binary system rotates, an Archimedean spiral detectable in the infrared is formed. The resulting pinwheel contains information on wind speeds, wind-momentum ratio, and orbital parameters. However, WR 147 is a WN star and the formation of dust is unlikely, so a different emission mechanism must be at work. Our analysis of the data suggests that in this case the emission is dominantly of a nonthermal nature (synchrotron), although we cannot exclude the possibility that some clumps could be brighter in free\textendash free emission. It is possible that the pinwheels associated with WN stars will be detectable only as nonthermal emitters at radio wavelengths. From the characteristics of the pinwheel we estimate a period of 1.7 yr for the binary system (the WN8 star and a companion yet undetected directly) that is responsible for the pinwheel.},

Application to 246 WR stars located in the field permits us to map their Galactic distribution. As anticipated, WR stars generally lie in the thin disc ({$\sim$}40\,pc half-width at half-maximum) between Galactocentric radii 3.5\textendash 10\,kpc, in accordance with other star formation tracers. We highlight 12 WR stars located at vertical distances of~{$\geq$}300\,pc from the mid-plane. Analysis of the radial variation in WR subtypes exposes a ubiquitously higher NWC/NWN ratio than predicted by stellar evolutionary models accounting for stellar rotation. Models for non-rotating stars or accounting for close binary evolution are more consistent with observations. We consolidate information acquired about the known WR content of the Milky Way to build a simple model of the complete population. We derive observable quantities over a range of wavelengths, allowing us to estimate a total number of 1900\,~{$\pm~$}\,250 Galactic WR stars, implying an average duration of~{$\sim$}\,0.4\,Myr for the WR phase at the current Milky Way star formation rate. Of relevance to future spectroscopic surveys, we use this model WR population to predict follow-up spectroscopy to KS\, {$\simeq$} \,17.5~mag will be necessary to identify 95\,per\,cent of Galactic WR stars. We anticipate that ESA's Gaia mission will make few additional WR star discoveries via low-resolution spectroscopy, though will significantly refine existing distance determinations.

Under a suitable stepsize restriction, these methods share a desirable nonlinear stability property with the underlying PDE, e.g., stability with respect to total variation, the maximum norm, or other convex functional. This is of particular interest when the solution exhibits shock-like or other nonsmooth behavior. Many results are known for SSPRK methods with nonnegative coefficients. However, it has recently been shown that such methods cannot exist with order greater than 4. In this paper, we give a systematic treatment of explicit SSPRK methods with general (i.e., possibly negative) coefficients up to order 5. In particular, we show how to optimally treat negative coefficients (corresponding to a change in the upwind direction of the spatial discretization) in the context of effective CFL coefficient maximization and provide proofs of optimality of some explicit SSPRK methods of orders 1 to 4. We also give the first known explicit fifth-order SSPRK schemes and show their effectiveness in practice versus more well-known fifth-order explicit Runge-Kutta schemes.},

Unambiguous constraints on the fraction of massive stars affected by binary interaction were lacking. We simultaneously measured all relevant binary characteristics in a sample of Galactic massive O stars and quantified the frequency and nature of binary interactions. More than 70\% of all massive stars will exchange mass with a companion, leading to a binary merger in one-third of the cases. These numbers greatly exceed previous estimates and imply that binary interaction dominates the evolution of massive stars, with implications for populations of massive stars and their supernovae.

These data provide the empirical basis of studies of (i) the role of WC stars in the evolution of massive stars, (ii) the wind-driving mechanisms, and (iii) the feedback of WC stars as input to models of the chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies. Methods: We analyze the nearly complete sample of un-obscured Galactic WC stars, using optical spectra as well as ultraviolet spectra when available. The observations are fitted with theoretical spectra, using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. A large grid of line-blanked models has been established for the range of WC subtypes WC4 - WC8, and smaller grids for the WC9 parameter domain.

Results: Stellar and atmospheric parameters are derived for more than 50 GalacticWC and two WO stars, covering almost the whole GalacticWC population as far as the stars are single, and un-obscured in the visual. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, theWC stars reside between the hydrogen and the helium zero-age main sequences, having luminosities L from 10\^4.9 to 10\^5.6 Lsun. The mass-loss rates scale very tightly with L\^0.8. The two WO stars in our sample turn out to be outstandingly hot (\textbackslash approx200 kK) and do not fit into the WC scheme. Conclusions: By comparing the empirical WC positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with evolutionary models, and from recent supernova statistics, we conclude that WC stars have evolved from initial masses between 20 solar masses and 45 Msun. In contrast to previous assumptions, it seems that WC stars in general do not descend from the most massive stars.

  abstract = {Wolf-Rayet stars of the carbon sequence (WC stars) are an important cornerstone in the late evolution of massive stars before their core collapse. As core-helium burning, hydrogen-free objects with huge mass-loss, they are likely the last observable stage before collapse and thus promising progenitor candidates for type Ib/c supernovae. Their strong mass-loss furthermore provides challenges and constraints to the theory of radiatively driven winds. Thus, the determination of the WC star parameters is of major importance for several astrophysical fields. With Gaia DR2, for the first time parallaxes for a large sample of Galactic WC stars are available, removing major uncertainties inherent to earlier studies. In this work, we re-examine a previously studied sample of WC stars to derive key properties of the Galactic WC population. All quantities depending on the distance are updated, while the underlying spectral analyzes remain untouched. Contrasting earlier assumptions, our study yields that WC stars of the same subtype can significantly vary in absolute magnitude. With Gaia DR2, the picture of the Galactic WC population becomes more complex: We obtain luminosities ranging from logL/L\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} = 4.9-6.0 with one outlier (WR 119) having logL/L\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} = 4.7. This indicates that the WC stars are likely formed from a broader initial mass range than previously assumed. We obtain mass-loss rates ranging between log \.M = -5.1 and -4.1, with \.M {$\propto$} L\textsuperscript{0.68} and a linear scaling of the modified wind momentum with luminosity. We discuss the implications for stellar evolution, including unsolved issues regarding the need of envelope inflation to address the WR radius problem, and the open questions in regard to the connection of WR stars with Gamma-ray bursts. WC and WO stars are progenitors of massive black holes, collapsing either silently or in a supernova that most-likely has to be preceded by a WO stage.},

Regardless of whether they were stripped by a binary companion or managed to peel off their outer layers by themselves, the influence and final fate of helium stars \textendash{} in particular the resulting black hole mass \textendash{} highly depends on their wind mass-loss as stripped-envelope objects. While empirical mass-loss constraints for massive helium stars have improved over the last decades, the resulting recipes are limited to metallicities with the observational ability to sufficiently resolve individual stars. Yet, theoretical efforts have been hampered by the complexity of Wolf\textendash Rayet (WR) winds arising from the more massive helium stars. In an unprecedented effort, we calculate next-generation stellar atmosphere models resembling massive helium main-sequence stars with Fe-bump driven winds up to \$500\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$ over a wide metallicity range between 2.0 and \$0.02\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{Z\}\_\textbackslash odot\$. We uncover a complex {$\Gamma$}e-dependency of WR-type winds and their metallicity-dependent breakdown. The latter can be related to the onset of multiple scattering, requiring higher L/M-ratios at lower metallicity. Based on our findings, we derive the first ever theoretically motivated mass-loss recipe for massive helium stars. We also provide estimates for Lyman continuum and \$\textbackslash rm\{He\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash small II\}\}\$\,ionizing fluxes, finding stripped helium stars to contribute considerably at low metallicity. In sharp contrast to OB-star winds, the mass-loss for helium stars scales with the terminal velocity. While limited to the helium main sequence, our study marks a major step towards a better theoretical understanding of helium star evolution.},

The spectral energy distributions are also found to be like that of O stars in that they do not exhibit large attenuation of X-rays softer than 1 keV. This indicates that for both the O stars and WR stars much of the X-ray emission is coming from hot wisps or shocks in the outer regions of the winds and not from a thin source at the base of the wind.

Massive stars play a vital role in the Universe, however, their evolution even on the main-sequence is not yet well understood. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: Because of the steep mass-luminosity relation, massive main-sequence stars become extremely luminous. This brings their envelopes very close to the Eddington limit. We analyse stellar evolutionary models in which the Eddington limit is reached and exceeded, explore the rich diversity of physical phenomena that take place in their envelopes, and investigate their observational consequences. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We use published grids of detailed stellar models, computed with a state-of-the-art, one-dimensional hydrodynamic stellar evolution code using LMC composition, to investigate the envelope properties of core hydrogen burning massive stars. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: We find that the Eddington limit is almost never reached at the stellar surface, even for stars up to 500 M\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}. When we define an appropriate Eddington limit locally in the stellar envelope, we can show that most stars more massive than \textasciitilde 40 M\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}} actually exceed this limit, in particular, in the partial ionisation zones of iron, helium, or hydrogen. While most models adjust their structure such that the local Eddington limit is exceeded at most by a few per cent, our most extreme models do so by a factor of more than seven. We find that the local violation of the Eddington limit has severe consequences for the envelope structure, as it leads to envelope inflation, convection, density inversions, and, possibly to, pulsations. We find that all models with luminosities higher than 4 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{5}L\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}, i.e. stars above \textasciitilde 40 M\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}} show inflation, with a radius increase of up to a factor of about 40. We find that the hot edge of the S Dor variability region coincides with a line beyond which our models are inflated by more than a factor of two, indicating a possible connection between S Dor variability and inflation. Furthermore, our coolest models show highly inflated envelopes with masses of up to several solar masses, and appear to be candidates for producing major luminous blue variable eruptions. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Conclusions: Our models show that the Eddington limit is expected to be reached in all stars above \textasciitilde 40 M\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}} in the LMC, even in lower mass stars in the Galaxy, or in close binaries or rapid rotators. While our results do not support the idea of a direct super-Eddington wind driven by continuum photons, the consequences of the Eddington limit in the form of inflation, pulsations and possibly eruptions may well give rise to a significant enhancement of the time averaged mass-loss rate. {$<$}P /{$>$}Appendices are available in electronic form at {$<$}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201525945/olm"{$>$}http://www.aanda.org{$<$}/A{$>$}},

  abstract = {Methods. Spectroscopy was performed using the Potsdam Wolf\textendash Rayet (PoWR) code and cross-correlation techniques. Disentanglement was performed using the code Spectangular or the shift-and-add algorithm. Evolutionary status was interpreted using the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) code, exploring binary interaction and chemically homogeneous evolution. Results. Among our sample, 28/44 objects show composite spectra and are analyzed as such. An additional five targets show periodically moving WR primaries but no detected companions (SB1); two (BAT99 99 and 112) are potential WR + compact-object candidates owing to their high X-ray luminosities. We cannot confirm the binary nature of the remaining 11 candidates. About two-thirds of the WN components in binaries are identified as cWR, and one-third as hydrogen-burning WR stars. We establish metallicity-dependent mass-loss recipes, which broadly agree with those recently derived for single WN stars, and in which so-called WN3/O3 stars are clear outliers. We estimate that 45 {$\pm$} 30\% of the cWR stars in our sample have interacted with a companion via mass transfer. However, only {$\approx$}12 {$\pm$} 7\% of the cWR stars in our sample naively appear to have formed purely owing to stripping via a companion (12\% b-WR). Assuming that apparently single WR stars truly formed as single stars, this comprises {$\approx$}4\% of the whole LMC WN population, which is about ten times less than expected. No obvious differences in the properties of single and binary WN stars, whose luminosities extend down to log L {$\approx$} 5.2 [L ], are apparent. With the exception of a few systems (BAT99 19, 49, and 103), the equatorial rotational velocities of the OB-type companions are moderate (veq 250 km s-1) and challenge standard formalisms of angular-momentum accretion. For most objects, chemically homogeneous evolution can be rejected for the secondary, but not for the WR progenitor. Conclusions. No obvious dichotomy in the locations of apparently single and binary WN stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is apparent. According to commonly used stellar evolution models (BPASS, Geneva), most apparently single WN stars could not have formed as single stars, implying that they were stripped by an undetected companion. Otherwise, it must follow that pre-WR mass-loss/mixing (e.g., during the red supergiant phase) are strongly underestimated in standard stellar evolution models.},

  abstract = {A handful of binary Wolf-Rayet stars are known to harbour spectacular spiral structures spanning a few hundred AU. These systems host some of the highest dust production rates in the Universe and are therefore interesting candidates to address the origin of the enigmatic dust excess observed across galactic evolution. The substantial interaction between the winds of the Wolf-Rayet star and its companion constitutes a unique laboratory to study the mechanisms of dust nucleation in a hostile environment. Using the grid-based RAMSES code, we investigate this problem by performing a 3D hydrodynamic simulation of the inner region of the prototypical spiral nebula around WR104. We then process the RAMSES results using the radiative transfer code RADMC3d to generate a candidate observable scene. This allows us to estimate the geometrical parameters of the shocked region. We link those quantities to the specific chemical pathway for dust nucleation, where the hydrogen-rich companion's wind catalyses dust formation. The scaling laws we derive constitute a unique tool that can be directly compared to observations. Depending on the dust nucleation locus, the velocity field reveals a differential wind speed, implying that the initial dust speed could be more balanced between the speeds of the two stellar winds ({$\sim$}1600~km/s). With RADMC3d, we provide constraints on the dust nucleation radius for different combinations of dust-to-gas ratio, hydrogen fraction and dust grain properties. Finally, our models reveal that dust may escape beyond the boundaries of the spiral due to hydrodynamical instabilities in the wind collision zone.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} WR104 is an emblematic dusty Wolf-Rayet star and the prototypical member of a sub-group hosting spirals that are mainly observable with high-angular resolution techniques. Previous aperture masking observations showed that WR104 is likely to be an interacting binary star at the end of its life. However, several aspects of the system are still unknown. This includes the opening angle of the spiral, the dust formation locus, and the link between the central binary star and a candidate companion star detected with the \emph{Hubble{$<$}i/{$>$} Space Telescope (HST) at 1{${'}{'}$}.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} Our aim was to directly image the dusty spiral or ``pinwheel'' structure around WR104 for the first time and determine its physical properties at large spatial scales. We also wanted to address the characteristics of the candidate companion detected by the HST.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} For this purpose, we used SPHERE and VISIR at the Very Large Telescope to image the system in the near- and mid-infrared, respectively. Both instruments furnished an excellent view of the system at the highest angular resolution a single, ground-based telescope can provide. Based on these direct images, we then used analytical and radiative transfer models to determine several physical properties of the system.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Employing a different technique than previously used, our new images have allowed us to confirm the presence of the dust pinwheel around the central star. We have also detected up to five revolutions of the spiral pattern of WR104 in the \emph{K{$<$}i/{$>$} band for the first time. The circumstellar dust extends up to 2 arcsec from the central binary star in the \emph{N{$<$}i/{$>$} band, corresponding to the past 20 yr of mass loss. Moreover, we found no clear evidence of a shadow of the first spiral coil onto the subsequent ones, which likely points to a dusty environment less massive than inferred in previous studies. We have also confirmed that the stellar candidate companion previously detected by the HST is gravitationally bound to WR104 and herein provide information about its nature and orbital elements.}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {In early Solar System during the runaway growth stage of planetary formation, the distribution of planetary bodies progressively evolved from a large number of planetesimals to a smaller number of objects with a few dominant embryos. Here, we study the possible thermal and compositional evolution of these planetesimals and planetary embryos in a series of models with increasing complexities. We show that the heating stages of planetesimals by the radioactive decay of now extinct isotopes (in particular 26Al) and by impact heating can occur in two stages or simultaneously. Depending on the accretion rate, melting occurs from the center outward, in a shallow outer shell progressing inward, or in the two locations. We discuss the regime domains of these situations and show that the exponent {$\beta$} that controls the planetary growth rate R\textperiodcentered{$\propto$}R{$\beta$} of planetesimals plays a crucial role. For a given terminal radius and accretion duration, the increase of {$\beta$} maintains the planetesimals very small until the end of accretion, and therefore allows radioactive heating to be radiated away before a large mass can be accreted. To melt the center of {$\sim$}500km planetesimal during its runaway growth stage, with the value {$\beta$}=2 predicted by astrophysicists, it needs to be formed within a couple of million years after condensation of the first solids. We then develop a multiphase model where the phase changes and phase separations by compaction are taken into account in 1-D spherical geometry. Our model handles simultaneously metal and silicates in both solid and liquid states. The segregation of the protocore decreases the efficiency of radiogenic heating by confining the 26Al in the outer silicate shell. Various types of planetesimals partly differentiated and sometimes differentiated in multiple metal\textendash silicate layers can be obtained.},

The corresponding continuum radiative transfer problem is described, and the numerical requirements for inverse 3D density and temperature modeling are defined. We introduce a relative intensity and transform the radiative transfer equation along the rays to solve machine precision problems and to relax strong gradients in the source term. For the optically thick regions where common ray tracers are forced to perform small trace steps, we give two criteria for making use of a simple approximative solver crossing the optically thick region quickly. Using an example of a density structure with optical depth changes of 6 orders of magnitude and sharp temperature variations, we demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed scheme using a common fifth-order Runge-Kutta ray tracer with adaptive step-size control. In our test case, the gain in computational speed is about a factor of 870. The method is applied in order to calculate the temperature distribution within a massive molecular cloud core for different boundary conditions for the radiation field.},

  abstract = {Cosmic dust is present in many astrophysical objects, and recent observations across the electromagnetic spectrum show that the dust distribution is often strongly three-dimensional (3D). Dust grains are effective in absorbing and scattering ultraviolet (UV)/optical radiation, and they re-emit the absorbed energy at infrared wavelengths. Understanding the intrinsic properties of these objects, including the dust itself, therefore requires 3D dust radiative transfer (RT) calculations. Unfortunately, the 3D dust RT problem is nonlocal and nonlinear, which makes it one of the hardest challenges in computational astrophysics. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made in the past decade, with an increasing number of codes capable of dealing with the complete 3D dust RT problem. We discuss the complexity of this problem, the two most successful solution techniques [ray-tracing (RayT) and Monte Carlo (MC)], and the state of the art in modeling observational data using 3D dust RT codes. We end with an outlook on the bright future of this field.},

Along with a 2nd order finite differencing approach, the grids are optimized to reduce the discretization error and provide global error control. The full wavelength-dependent problem is solved without any flux approximation, and for arbitrary scattering properties of the dust. The program is designed to provide spatially resolved images, visibilities, and spectra of complex dust distributions even without any symmetry for wavelengths ranging from the UV to FIR and allows for multiple internal and external sources. In this paper, the algorithm is described and the capabilities of the code are illustrated by the treatment of 1D and 3D test cases. Analyzing the properties of typical cosmic dust, we discuss the wavelength range for which the time-consuming solution on adaptive grids can be omitted.

These instabilities disrupt the postshock flow and add a time variability of order 10 percent to the X-ray luminosity.

The framework works with both uniform and nonuniform grids in Cartesian and curvilinear coordinate systems. It adopts a dynamic execution model based on a simple design called a "task list" that improves parallel performance by overlapping communication and computation, simplifies the inclusion of a diverse range of physics, and even enables multiphysics models involving different physics in different regions of the calculation. We describe physics modules implemented in this framework for both non-relativistic and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). These modules adopt mature and robust algorithms originally developed for the Athena MHD code and incorporate new extensions: support for curvilinear coordinates, higher-order time integrators, more realistic physics such as a general equation of state, and diffusion terms that can be integrated with super-time-stepping algorithms. The modules show excellent performance and scaling, with well over 80\% parallel efficiency on over half a million threads. The source code has been made publicly available.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary tracks for 30-90 Msun stars, computed along the lines described in our recent series of papers, suggest that luminous blue variables (LBVs) are the blue remnants of a prior phase of heavy mass loss. They are now intermittently experiencing ionization-induced dynamical instability within their hydrogen-poor envelopes, while their massive helium cores are in an advanced stage of central helium burning. In the H-R diagram, our new evolutionary models successfully explain the high- and low- temperature limits, the low-luminosity limit, and the relative luminosity function of the observed LBVs at quiescence which have log (L/Lsun) {$<$} 6.3. Metal-poor LBVs are predicted (correctly, in the only case known) to be significantly cooler than LBVs with normal metallicities. In the (mass, luminosity) plane, the models and observed stars agree closely, and show no discernible metals dependence. Predicted values of the surface hydrogen abundance and of the expelled mass during the LBV phase match reasonably well the available observational data, which, however, are still very crude. The observed cycles of mass loss are predicted correctly. Pre-LBV and post-LBV stars can be identified with the hydrogen-poor and hydrogen-free WN stars, respectively. Post-red-supergiant lifetimes, derived from published star counts and kinematical ages of nebulae around the WN stars and LBVs, are used to infer an approximate mean value of the rate of stellar wind mass loss from luminous red supergiants. This parameter is crucial for understanding stellar evolution at log (L/Lsun) {$<$} 5.8. Stars more luminous may never become red, and may spend all, or nearly all, of their post-main-sequence lives as blue supergiants. Our theory of LBVs makes a number of other predictions that have not yet been tested. A critical comparison with the very different theory of Langer et al. is presented.},

We have examined the nature of this overstability in one and two dimensions using numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We find that one-dimensional simulations of a uniform flow incident upon a reflecting wall produce oscillation frequencies in agreement with those of earlier analytic (Chevalier \& Imamura 1982) and numerical (Imamura, Wolff, \& Durisen 1984) work. We do not, however, find any evidence for positive growth rates. This result is not in contradiction with previous linear analysis because the supersonic flow into a wall problem is at a saturated, nonlinear amplitude from the beginning. In the case of one-dimensional steady state shocks in the absence of a solid wall, we find a slightly different dependence of the overstability on {$\alpha$} when we assume a cooling rate proportional to T{$\alpha$}. In this case oscillations in radiative shocks with {$\alpha$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.75 are found to saturate at a finite amplitude, i.e., the relevant critical value of alpha is at least above 0.5. We also find high Mach number systems to be less stable than low Mach number systems subject to the same cooling law. Simulations of two-dimensional steady state shocks reveal that transverse perturbations in the shock front quickly manifest themselves in the cold, dense gas layer downstream of the cooling region. Perturbations in the cold gas layer are dominated by spatial wavelengths, {$\lambda$} {$\lessequivlnt$} Lc, the cooling length of the shock. The action of this instability ensures that interstellar radiative shocks will not be smooth on length scales of order the local cooling length.},

  abstract = {Suzaku observations of the Wolf\textendash Rayet (W\textendash R) binary WR\,140 (WC7pd+O5.5fc) were made at four different times around periastron passage in 2009 January. The spectra changed in shape and flux with the phase. As periastron approached, the column density of the low-energy absorption increased, which indicates that the emission from the wind\textendash wind collision plasma was absorbed by the dense W\textendash R wind. The spectra can be mostly fitted with two different components: a warm component with kBT = 0.3\textendash 0.6~keV and a dominant hot component with kBT {$\sim$} 3~keV. The emission measure of the dominant, hot component is not inversely proportional to the distance between the two stars. This can be explained by the O star wind colliding before it has reached its terminal velocity, leading to a reduction in its wind momentum flux. At phases closer to periastron, we discovered a cool plasma component in a recombining phase, which is less absorbed. This component may be a relic of the wind\textendash wind collision plasma, which was cooled down by radiation, and may represent a transitional stage in dust formation.},

  abstract = {We present a numerical approach for accurately evolving a dust grain-size distribution undergoing number-conserving (such as sputtering) and/or mass-conserving (such as shattering) processes. As typically observed interstellar dust distributions follow a power law, our method adopts a power-law discretization and uses both the grain mass and number densities in each bin to determine the power-law parameters. This power-law method is complementary to piecewise-constant and linear methods in the literature. We find that the power-law method surpasses the other two approaches, especially for small bin numbers. In the sputtering tests, the relative error in the total grain mass remains below 0.01~per\,cent independent of the number of bins N, while the other methods only achieve this for N \&gt; 50 or higher. Likewise, the shattering test shows that the method also produces small relative errors in the total grain numbers while conserving mass. Not only does the power-law method conserve the global distribution properties, it also preserves the inter-bin characteristics so that the shape of the distribution is recovered to a high degree. This does not always happen for the constant and linear methods, especially not for small bin numbers. Implementing the power-law method in a hydrodynamical code thus minimizes the numerical cost while maintaining high accuracy. The method is not limited to dust grain distributions, but can also be applied to the evolution of any distribution function, such as a cosmic ray distribution affected by synchrotron radiation or inverse-Compton scattering.},

  abstract = {Following the observational and theoretical evidence that points at core collapse supernovae as major producers of dust, here we calculate the hydrodynamics of the matter reinserted within young and massive super stellar clusters under the assumption of gas and dust radiative cooling. The large supernova rate expected in massive clusters allows for a continuous replenishment of dust immersed in the high temperature thermalized reinserted matter and warrants a stationary presence of dust within the cluster volume during the type II supernova era. We first show that such a balance determines the range of dust to gas mass ratio and this the dust cooling law. We then search for the critical line that separates stationary cluster winds from the bimodal cases in the cluster mechanical luminosity (or cluster mass) vs cluster size parameter space. In the latter, strong radiative cooling reduces considerably the cluster wind mechanical energy output and affects particularly the cluster central regions, leading to frequent thermal instabilities that diminish the pressure and inhibit the exit of the reinserted matter. Instead matter accumulates there and is expected to eventually lead to gravitational instabilities and to further stellar formation with the matter reinserted by former massive stars. The main outcome of the calculations is that the critical line is almost two orders of magnitude or more, depending on the assumed value of VA{$\infty$}, lower than when only gas radiative cooling is applied. And thus, many massive clusters are predicted to enter the bimodal regime.},

  abstract = {Context. The study of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) has lead to greatly improved insights into many fields in astrophysics, e.g. cosmology, and also into the metal enrichment of the universe. Although a theoretical explanation of the origin of these events is still lacking, there is a general consensus that SNIa are caused by the thermonuclear explosions of carbon/oxygen white dwarfs with masses near the Chandrasekhar mass. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: We investigate the potential contribution to the supernova Type Ia rate from the population of merging double carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. We aim to develop a model that fits the observed SNIa progenitors as well as the observed close double white dwarf population. We differentiate between two scenarios for the common envelope (CE) evolution; the {$\alpha$}-formalism based on the energy equation and the {$\gamma$}-formalism that is based on the angular momentum equation. In one model we apply the {$\alpha$}-formalism throughout. In the second model the {$\gamma$}-formalism is applied, unless the binary contains a compact object or the CE is triggered by a tidal instability for which the {$\alpha$}-formalism is used. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: The binary population synthesis code SeBa was used to evolve binary systems from the zero-age main sequence to the formation of double white dwarfs and subsequent mergers. SeBa has been thoroughly updated since the last publication of the content of the code. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: The limited sample of observed double white dwarfs is better represented by the simulated population using the {$\gamma$}-formalism for the first CE phase than the {$\alpha$}-formalism. For both CE formalisms, we find that although the morphology of the simulated delay time distribution matches that of the observations within the errors, the normalisation and time-integrated rate per stellar mass are a factor \textasciitilde 7-12 lower than observed. Furthermore, the characteristics of the simulated populations of merging double carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are discussed and put in the context of alternative SNIa models for merging double white dwarfs. {$<$}P /{$>$}Appendix A is available in electronic form at {$<$}A href="http://www.aanda.org"{$>$}http://www.aanda.org{$<$}/A{$>$}},

  abstract = {To classify a book as 'experimental' rather than 'theoretical' or as 'pure' rather than 'applied' is liable to imply umeal distinctions. Nevertheless, some Classification is necessary to teIl the potential reader whether the book is for him. In this spirit, this book may be said to treat fluid dynamies as a branch of physics, rather than as a branch of applied mathematics or of engineering. I have often heard expressions of the need for such a book, and certainly I have feIt it in my own teaching. I have written it primariIy for students of physics and of physics-based applied science, aIthough I hope others may find it useful. The book differs from existing 'fundamental' books in placing much greater emphasis on what we know through laboratory experiments and their physical interpretation and less on the mathe matieal formalism. It differs from existing 'applied' books in that the choice of topics has been made for the insight they give into the behaviour of fluids in motion rather than for their practical importance. There are differences also from many existing books on fluid dynamics in the branches treated, reflecting to some extent shifts of interest in reeent years. In particular, geophysical and astrophysical applications have prompted important fundamental developments in topics such as conveetion, stratified flow, and the dynamics of rotating fluids. These developments have hitherto been reflected in the contents of textbooks only to a limited extent.},

  abstract = {Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are luminous massive blue stars thought to be immediate precursors to the supernova terminating their brief lives. The existence of dust shells around such stars has been enigmatic since their discovery some 30 years ago; the intense radiation field from the star should be inimical to dust survival. Although dust-creation models, including those involving interacting stellar winds from a companion star, have been put forward, high-resolution observations are required to understand this phenomena. Here we present resolved images of the dust outflow around Wolf-Rayet WR 104, obtained with novel imaging techniques, revealing detail on scales corresponding to about 40 AU at the star. Our maps show that the dust forms a spatially confined stream following precisely a linear (or Archimedian) spiral trajectory. Images taken at two separate epochs show a clear rotation with a period of 220 +/- 30 days. Taken together, these findings prove that a binary star is responsible for the creation of the circumstellar dust, while the spiral plume makes WR 104 the prototype of a new class of circumstellar nebulae unique to interacting wind systems.},

  abstract = {Results from the most extensive study of the time-evolving dust structure around the prototype "Pinwheel" nebula WR 104 are presented. Encompassing 11 epochs in three near-infrared filter bandpasses, a homogeneous imaging data set spanning more than 6 years (or 10 orbits) is presented. Data were obtained from the highly successful Keck Aperture Masking Experiment, which can recover high fidelity images at extremely high angular resolutions, revealing the geometry of the plume with unprecedented precision. Inferred properties for the (unresolved) underlying binary and wind system are orbital period 241.5 +/- 0.5 days and angular outflow velocity of 0.28 +/- 0.02 mas/day. An optically thin cavity of angular size 13.3 +/- 1.4 mas was found to lie between the central binary and the onset of the spiral dust plume. Rotational motion of the wind system induced by the binary orbit is found to have important ramifications: entanglement of the winds results in strong shock activity far downstream from the nose of the bowshock. The far greater fraction of the winds participating in the collision may play a key role in gas compression and the nucleation of dust at large radii from the central binary and shock stagnation point. Investigation of the effects of radiative braking pointed towards significant modifications of the simple hydrostatic colliding wind geometry, extending the relevance of this phenomena to wider binary systems than previously considered. Limits placed on the maximum allowed orbital eccentricity of e {$<$} 0.06 argue strongly for a prehistory of tidal circularization in this system. Finally we discuss the implications of Earth's polar (i {$<$} 16 deg) vantage point onto a system likely to host supernova explosions at future epochs.},

Intrinsic colours and absolute visual magnitudes per subtype are re-assessed for a re-determination of optical photometric distances and galactic distribution of WR stars.

The galactocentric distance (RWR) distribution per subtype shows RWR increasing with decreasing WR subtype, both for the WN and WC subtypes.

  abstract = {A method of second-order accuracy is described for integrating the equations of ideal compressible flow. The method is based on the integral conservation laws and is dissipative, so that it can be used across shocks. The heart of the method is a one-dimensional Lagrangean scheme that may be regarded as a second-order sequel to Godunov's method. The second-order accuracy is achieved by taking the distributions of the state quantities inside a gas slab to be linear, rather than uniform as in Godunov's method. The Lagrangean results are remapped with least-squares accuracy onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Several monotonicity algorithms are applied to ensure positivity, monotonicity and nonlinear stability. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting. Numerical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows are presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the method. The paper concludes with a summary of the results of the whole series ``Towards the Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme.''},

  abstract = {We have performed a pilot study of mass loss predictions for late-type Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars as a function of metal abundance, over a range between 10-5 {$\leq$} (Z/Z ) {$\leq$} 10. We find that the winds of nitrogen-rich Wolf-Rayet stars are dominated by iron lines, with a dependence of mass loss on Z similar to that of massive OB stars. For more evolved, carbon-rich, WR stars the wind strength is also found to be dependent on the Fe abundance, so that they depend on the chemical environment of the host galaxy, but with a mass loss metallicity dependence that is less steep than for OB stars. Our finding that WR mass loss is Z-dependent is a new one, with important consequences for black hole formation and X-ray population studies in external galaxies. A further finding of our study is that the Z dependence of C-rich WR stars becomes weaker at metallicities below Z/Z {$<\sim$} 1/10, and mass loss no longer declines once the metal abundance drops below (Z/Z ) 10-3. This is the result of an increased importance of radiative driving by intermediate mass elements, such as carbon. In combination with rapid rotation and/or proximity to the Eddington limit \textendash{} likely to be relevant for massive Population  stars \textendash{} this effect may indicate a role for mass loss in the appearance and evolution of these objects, as well as a potential role for stellar winds in enriching the intergalactic medium of the early Universe.},

  abstract = {We study the origin of the bi-stability jump in the terminal velocity of the winds of supergiants near spectral type B1. Observations show that here the ratio \{v\_infty/v\_esc\} drops steeply from about 2.6 at types earlier than B1 to a value of \{v\_infty/v\_esc\}=1.3 at types later than B2. To this purpose, we have calculated wind models and mass-loss rates for early-type supergiants in a T\_eff grid covering the range between T\_eff = 12 500 and 40 000 K. These models show the existence of a jump in mass loss around T\_eff = 25 000 K for normal supergiants, with dot \{M\} increasing by about a factor five from T\_eff =\textasciitilde{} 27 500 to 22 500 K for constant luminosity. The wind efficiency number eta =M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} \{v\_infty\} / (L\_*/c) also increases drastically by a factor of 2 - 3 near that temperature. We argue that the jump in mass loss is accompanied by a decrease of the ratio \{v\_infty/v\_esc\}, which is the observed bi-stability jump in terminal velocity. Using self-consistent models for two values of T\_eff, we have derived \{v\_infty/v\_esc\} = 2.4 for T\_eff = 30 000 K and \{v\_infty/v\_esc\} = 1.2 for T\_eff = 17 500 K. This is within 10 percent of the observed values around the jump. Up to now, a theoretical explanation of the observed bi-stability jump was not yet provided by radiation driven wind theory. To understand the origin of the bi-stability jump, we have investigated the line acceleration for models around the jump in detail. These models demonstrate that M\textsubscript{{$\odot$}} increases around the bi-stability jump due to an increase in the line acceleration of Fe iii below the sonic point. This shows that the mass-loss rate of B-type supergiants is very sensitive to the abundance and the ionization balance of iron. Furthermore, we show that the elements C, N and O are important line drivers in the supersonic part of the wind. The subsonic part of the wind is dominated by the line acceleration due to Fe. Therefore, CNO-processing is expected not to have a large impact on dot \{M\},but it might have impact on the terminal velocities. Finally, we discuss the possible role of the bi-stability jump on the mass loss during typical variations of Luminous Blue Variable stars.},

  abstract = {Massive stars have strong stellar winds that direct their evolution through the upper Hertzsprung\textendash Russell diagram and determine the black hole mass function. Furthermore, wind strength dictates the atmospheric structure that sets the ionizing flux. Finally, the wind directly intervenes with the stellar envelope structure, which is decisive for both single-star and binary evolution, affecting predictions for gravitational wave events. Key findings of current hot star research include: {$\blacksquare$} The traditional line-driven wind theory is being updated with Monte Carlo and comoving frame computations, revealing a rich multivariate behavior of the mass-loss rate in terms of M, L, Eddington {$\Gamma$}, Teff, and chemical composition Z. Concerning the latter, is shown to depend on the iron (Fe) opacity, making Wolf\textendash Rayet populations, and gravitational wave events dependent on host galaxy Z. {$\blacksquare$} On top of smooth mass-loss behavior, there are several transitions in the Hertzsprung\textendash Russell diagram, involving bistability jumps around Fe recombination temperatures, leading to quasi-stationary episodic, and not necessarily eruptive, luminous blue variable and pre-SN mass loss. {$\blacksquare$} Furthermore, there are kinks. At 100 a high {$\Gamma$} mass-loss transition implies that hydrogen-rich, very massive stars have higher mass-loss rates than commonly considered. At the other end of the mass spectrum, low-mass stripped helium stars no longer appear as Wolf\textendash Rayet stars but as optically thin stars. These stripped stars, in addition to very massive stars, are two newly identified sources of ionizing radiation that could play a key role in local star formation as well as at high redshift.},

  abstract = {We have used the AMR hydrodynamic code, MG, to perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations with self-gravity of stellar feedback in a spherical clumpy molecular cloud formed through the action of thermal instability. We simulate the interaction of the mechanical energy input from 15, 40, 60 and 120 M stars into a 100 pc diameter 16 500 M cloud with a roughly spherical morphology with randomly distributed high-density condensations. The stellar winds are introduced using appropriate non-rotating Geneva stellar evolution models. In the 15 M star case, the wind has very little effect, spreading around a few neighbouring clumps before becoming overwhelmed by the cloud collapse. In contrast, in the 40, 60 and 120 M star cases, the more powerful stellar winds create large cavities and carve channels through the cloud, breaking out into the surrounding tenuous medium during the wind phase and considerably altering the cloud structure. After 4.97, 3.97 and 3.01 Myr, respectively, the massive stars explode as supernovae (SNe). The wind-sculpted surroundings considerably affect the evolution of these SN events as they both escape the cloud along wind-carved channels and sweep up remaining clumps of cloud/wind material. The `cloud' as a coherent structure does not survive the SN from any of these stars, but only in the 120 M case is the cold molecular material completely destabilized and returned to the unstable thermal phase. In the 40 and 60 M cases, coherent clumps of cold material are ejected from the cloud by the SN, potentially capable of further star formation.},

  abstract = {In this thesis, a three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program has been described, made parallel, tested and applied to astrophysical problems. The program, named CUBEMPI, was made parallel using the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) library and examined via simple efficiency tests and more complex performance profilers within the Multi-Processing Environment (MPE) library of MPI. CUBEMPI was tested with various hydrodynamical problems, CUBEMPI successfully completed all tests and its performance was compared with that of several other CFD schemes. Comparing CUBEMPI with these other schemes, no one scheme performed consistently better than any of the others, CUBEMPI efficiently computes accurate solutions to the Euler equations and thus can be used to simulate fluid flow. CUBEMPI has been shown to be particularly capable of simulating shocks in astrophysical conditions and so was used to consider planetary nebulae (PNe) and their interaction with the interstellar medium (ISM). Previous modelling of PNe moving through the ISM has been performed in two dimensions (2D) following a detailed evolutionary track of the PN-forming star moving at a low speed. Here CUBEMPI has been used to simulate the interaction in three dimensions (3D) with a range of proper motions using a generic simple "triple-wind" model for the formation of PNe. This modelling has considered the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and post-AGB stages of evolution and led to the conclusion that to understand the shape of a nebula inferred to be moving through the ISM, the AGB evolution must be considered as well as the post-AGB evolution as it has a strong shaping effect on the nebula. Signs of PN-ISM interaction are found not to be confined to ancient or extreme nebulae. In this thesis, simulated younger nebulae moving at low speeds show one-sided brightening and displacement of the central star from the geometric centre of the nebula. At higher speeds the nebulae are strongly affected and eventually no longer appear symmetric. The effect of ISM shaping on nebulae has been quantitatively shown in this thesis to be an explanation for the missing mass problem in PNe; much of the AGB material is swept downstream of the nebula. New observations of the crescent shaped nebula Sh 2-188 have been compared to the PN-ISM simulations and the nebula has been understood in terms of a PN moving at 125 kms[-1]. A proper motion study of the nebula has found it to be moving at 30 {$\pm$} 10 masyr[-1] in the direction of the bright crescent. The combination of these values has led to an estimate of the distance D = 850[+500-420] pc, diameter d \textasciitilde{} 2.5 pc and age t[PN] = 22,500 {$\pm$} 2,500 years. The triple-wind model explains the geometric displacement of the central star and the simulation estimates \textasciitilde{} 2/3 of the mass expected in the region of the star has been swept downstream. The nebula surrounding the classical nova GK Persei has also been investigated in terms of the triple-wind model using an asymmetric AGB wind. The model has produced a bipolar nebula of the shape observed around GK Per and high density equatorial regions which could account for the brightened emission in the southwest of the nova. Finally, improvements of CUBEMPI and the models are suggested.},

The objective, then and now, was to present the subject of computational ?uid dynamics (CFD) to an audience unfamiliar with all but the most basic numerical techniques and to do so in such a way that the practical application of CFD would become clear to everyone. A second edition appeared in 1995 with updates to all the chapters and when that printing came to an end, the publisher requested that the editor and authors consider the preparation of a third edition. Happily, the authors received the request with enthusiasm. The third edition has the goal of presenting additional updates and clari?cations while preserving the introductory nature of the material. The book is divided into three parts. John Anderson lays out the subject in Part I by ?rst describing the governing equations of ?uid dynamics, concentrating on their mathematical properties which contain the keys to the choice of the numerical approach. Methods of discretizing the equations are discussed and transformation techniques and grids are presented. Two examples of numerical methods close out this part of the book: source and vortex panel methods and the explicit method. Part II is devoted to four self-contained chapters on more advanced material. Roger Grundmann treats the boundary layer equations and methods of solution.},

Reynolds et al. suggested turbulent dissipation or magnetic field reconnection as possible heating sources. We investigate here the viability of MHD-wave mediated cosmic ray heating as a supplemental heating source. This heating rate depends on the gas density only through its linear dependence on the Alfv\'en speed, which goes as n\_e\^\{-1/2\}. We show that, scaled to appropriate values of cosmic ray energy density, cosmic ray heating can be significant. Furthermore, this heating is stable to perturbations. These results should also apply to warm ionized gas in other galaxies.},

Frequent eclipses were observed from WR 104, and several from WR 106, extending the 1994\textendash 2001 studies by Kato et al., but not supporting their phasing the variations in WR 104 with its `pinwheel' rotation period. Only four other stars showed eclipses, WR 50 (one of the dust-free stars), WR 69, WR 95 and WR 117, and there may have been an eclipse by WR 121, which had shown two eclipses in the past. No dust eclipses were shown by the `historic' eclipsers WR 103 and WR 113. The atmospheric eclipses of the latter were observed but the suggestion by David-Uraz et al. that dust may be partly responsible for these is not supported. Despite its frequent eclipses, there is no evidence in the infrared images of WR 104 for dust made in its eclipses, demonstrating that any dust formed in this process is not a significant contributor to its circumstellar dust cloud and suggesting that the same applies to the other stars showing fewer eclipses.},

The images resolve the dust cloud formed by WR 140 in 2001, allowing us to track its expansion and cooling, while the photometry allows tracking the average temperature and total mass of the dust. The combination of the two data sets constrains the optical properties of the dust, and suggests that they differ from those of the dust made by the WC9 dust-makers, including the classical `pinwheel', WR 104. The photometry of individual dust emission features shows them to be significantly redder in (nbL \textendash [3.99]), but bluer in ([7.9]\textendash [12.5]), than the binary, as expected from the spectra of heated dust and the stellar wind of a Wolf\textendash Rayet star. The most persistent dust features, two concentrations at the ends of a `bar' of emission to the south of the star, were observed to move with constant proper motions of 324 {$\pm$} 8 and 243 {$\pm$} 7 mas yr-1. Longer wavelength (4.68 and 12.5 {$\mu$}m) images show dust emission from the corresponding features from the previous (1993) periastron passage and dust formation episode, showing that the dust expanded freely in a low-density void for over a decade, with dust features repeating from one cycle to the next. A third persistent dust concentration to the east of the binary (the `arm') was found to have a proper motion {$\sim$}320 mas yr-1, and a dust mass about one-quarter that of the `bar'. Extrapolation of the motions of the concentrations back to the binary suggests that the eastern `arm' began expansion four to five months earlier than those in the southern `bar', consistent with the projected rotation of the binary axis and wind-collision region (WCR) on the sky. A comparison of model dust images and the observations constrains the intervals when the WCR was producing sufficiently compressed wind for dust nucleation in the WCR, and suggests that the distribution of this material was not uniform about the axis of the WCR, but more abundant in the following edge in the orbital plane.},

Both absorption and emission components showed strong variations. The variation of the absorption component as the O5 star was occulted by the wind-collision region (WCR) sets a tight constraint on its geometry. While the sightline to the O5 star traversed the WCR, the strength and breadth of the absorption component varied significantly on time-scales of days. An emission subpeak was observed on all our profiles. The variation of its radial velocity with orbital phase was shown to be consistent with formation in the WCR as it swung round the stars in their orbit. Modelling the profile gives a measure of the extent of the subpeak-forming region. In the phase range 0.93\textendash 0.99, the flux in the subpeak increased steadily, approximately inversely proportionally to the stellar separation, indicating that the shocked gas in the WCR where the line was formed was adiabatic. After periastron, the subpeak flux was anomalously strong and varied rapidly, suggesting formation in clumps downstream in the WCR. For most of the time, its flux exceeded the 2\textendash 10-keV X-ray emission, showing it to be a significant coolant of the shocked wind.},

Models of the shells, which are characterized by dust density, inner edge temperature, and radial extent are examined in order to determine the conditions necessary for dust formation. It is shown that circumstellar dust is formed in the wind and is a function of stellar subtype; a density increase is required for grain formation; and dust formation rates are generally constant.},

Optical spectroscopy confirms the classification of the companion as a B0 supergiant and suggests that the Balmer lines in its spectrum suffer in-fill from wind emission. Re-examination of the reddening suggests a revised distance of 3.5 kpc. In the near-IR, the amplitude of variation increases with wavelength, with no significant variation in J (nor is there in the visible), implying that it is the amount of dust in the wind of WR 70 that is varying. Period searches show a period near 2.82 yr (1030 d) but the variations are not strictly regular and there are other factors affecting the dust formation and repeatability of the light curves. There may be a secondary period near 5.88 yr but there is no evidence for periods less than a year. A model of the spectral energy distribution in 1991 gives a dust formation rate of 5.9 \texttimes{} 10-7 M yr-1, around one-third of the available carbon from the WC9 wind going into the wind-collision region, estimating its size from average WC9 and B0Ia wind properties. The fraction of carbon going into dust varied between {$\sim$}11 and 46 per cent during our campaign, possibly as a consequence of the stars moving in an elliptical orbit.},

These disks generally persist for several million years, during which time some material accretes onto the star, some is lost through outflows and photoevaporation, and some condenses into centimeter- and larger-sized bodies or planetesimals. Through observations mainly at IR through millimeter wavelengths, we can determine how common disks are at different ages; measure basic properties including mass, size, structure, and composition; and follow their varied evolutionary pathways. In this way, we see the first steps toward exoplanet formation and learn about the origins of the Solar System. This review addresses observations of the outer parts, beyond 1 AU, of protoplanetary disks with a focus on recent IR and (sub)millimeter results and an eye to the promise of new facilities in the immediate future.},

Comparison of spectra of WR 104 observed in 1995 and 1997 showed the absorption lines to be more conspicuous in the latter observation and the emission lines weaker, suggesting a selective eclipse of the WC9 star similar to that observed by Crowther in 1996. The WC9 emission-line spectra are shown to be less uniform than previously thought, showing a significant range of O ii line strengths. The only two WC9 stars in the observed sample that do not make circumstellar dust, WR 81 (He3{$\pm$}1316) and WR 92 (HD 157451), are found to have anomalously weak O ii and strong He ii lines.

  abstract = {We calculate the thermal equilibrium gas temperature of the diffuse interstellar medium. Our method incorporates a new photoelectric heating rate from small grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that accounts for a size distribution of particles extending from 100 to 3 A radius. We also include a detailed treatment of the ionization rates and heating due to the soft X-ray background and due to cosmic rays. Phase diagrams (thermal pressure P versus hydrogen density n) are presented for gas that is illuminated by local interstellar far-ultraviolet (FUV) and X-ray radiation fields. A stable two-phase medium is produced with thermal pressure in the range P/k approximately = to 103-4 K/cc. We demonstrate that photoelectric heating from PAHs dominates in the warm neutral phase (WNM) and cold neutral phase (CNM). If the C II (158 micrometers cooling per hydrogen nucleus in the solar neighborhood represents an average value for the Galaxy, we predict LCII approximately = to 7 x 107 solar luminosities from the CNM in the Galaxy, comparable to that observed by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE). We discuss the dependence of the results on absorbing column density, gas phase abundances, dust abundances and metallicity, FUV field, and the X-ray radiation field. These results will be useful in modeling the multiphase structure of high-velocity clouds in the halo, the interstellar matter (ISM) at other galactocentric radii, and the ISM in external galaxies and galactic nuclei.},

  abstract = {Nearly 150 years ago, the French astronomers Charles Wolf and Georges Rayet described stars with very conspicuous spectra that are dominated by bright and broad emission lines. Meanwhile termed Wolf-Rayet Stars after their discoverers, those objects turned out to represent important stages in the life of massive stars. As the first conference in a long time that was specifically dedicated to Wolf-Rayet stars, an international workshop was held in Potsdam, Germany, from 1.-5. June 2015. About 100 participants, comprising most of the leading experts in the field as well as as many young scientists, gathered for one week of extensive scientific exchange and discussions. Considerable progress has been reported throughout, e.g. on finding  such stars, modeling and analyzing their spectra, understanding their evolutionary context, and studying their circumstellar nebulae. While some major questions regarding Wolf-Rayet stars still remain open 150 years after their discovery, it is clear today that these objects are not just interesting stars as such, but also keystones in the evolution of galaxies. These proceedings summarize the talks and posters presented at the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet workshop. Moreover, they also include the questions, comments, and discussions emerging after each talk, thereby giving a rare overview not only about the research, but also about the current debates and unknowns in the field. The Scientific Organizing Committee (SOC) included Alceste Bonanos (Athens), Paul Crowther (Sheffield), John Eldridge (Auckland), Wolf-Rainer Hamann (Potsdam, Chair), John Hillier (Pittsburgh), Claus Leitherer (Baltimore), Philip Massey (Flagstaff), George Meynet (Geneva), Tony Moffat (Montreal), Nicole St-Louis (Montreal), and Dany Vanbeveren (Brussels).},

"A fine and thoroughly up-to-date textbook on nuclear physics . . . most welcome." -Physics Today (on the First Edition). What sets Introductory Nuclear Physics apart from other books on the subject is its presentation of nuclear physics as an integral part of modern physics. Placing the discipline within a broad historical and scientific context, it makes important connections to other fields such as elementary particle physics and astrophysics. Now fully revised and updated, this Second Edition explores the changing directions in nuclear physics, emphasizing new developments and current research-from superdeformation to quark-gluon plasma. Author Samuel S.M. Wong preserves those areas that established the First Edition as a standard text in university physics departments, focusing on what is exciting about the discipline and providing a concise, thorough, and accessible treatment of the fundamental aspects of nuclear properties. In this new edition, Professor Wong: * Includes a chapter on heavy-ion reactions-from high-spin states to quark-gluon plasma * Adds a new chapter on nuclear astrophysics * Relates observed nuclear properties to the underlying nuclear interaction and the symmetry principles governing subatomic particles * Regroups material and appendices to make the text easier to use * Lists Internet links to essential databases and research projects * Features end-of-chapter exercises using real-world data. Introductory Nuclear Physics, Second Edition is an ideal text for courses in nuclear physics at the senior undergraduate or first-year graduate level. It is also an important resource for scientists and engineers working with nuclei, for astrophysicists and particle physicists, and for anyone wishing to learn more about trends in the field.},

  abstract = {Rocky planets are common around other stars, but their atmospheric properties remain largely unconstrained. Thanks to a wealth of recent planet discoveries and upcoming advances in observing capability, we are poised to characterize the atmospheres of dozens of rocky exoplanets in this decade. The theoretical understanding of rocky exoplanet atmospheres has advanced considerably in the last few years, yielding testable predictions of their evolution, chemistry, dynamics, and even possible biosignatures. We review key progress in this field to date and discuss future objectives. Our major conclusions are as follows: {$\blacksquare$}Many rocky planets may form with initial H2\textendash He envelopes that are later lost to space, likely due to a combination of stellar UV/X-ray irradiation and internal heating. {$\blacksquare$}After the early stages of evolution, a wide diversity of atmospheric compositions is expected as a result of variations in host star flux, atmospheric escape rates, interior exchange, and other factors. {$\blacksquare$}Observations have ruled out both the presence of H-dominated atmospheres on several nearby rocky exoplanets and the presence of any thick atmosphere on one target. A more detailed atmospheric characterization of these planets and others will become possible in the near future. {$\blacksquare$}Exoplanet biosphere searches are an exciting future goal. However, reliable detections for a representative sample of planets will require further advances in observing capability and improvements in our understanding of abiotic planetary processes. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics Volume 60 is August 2022.

  abstract = {WR 118 is a highly evolved Wolf-Rayet star of the WC10 subtype surrounded by a permanent dust shell absorbing and re-emitting in the infrared a considerable fraction of the stellar luminosity. We present the first diffraction-limited 2.13 \textmu m speckle interferometric observations of WR 118 with 73 mas resolution. The speckle interferograms were obtained with the 6 m telescope at the Special Astrophysical Observatory. The twodimensional visibility function of the object does not show any significant deviation from circular symmetry. The visibility curve declines towards the diffraction cut-off frequency to {$\sim$}0.66 and can be approximated by a linear function. Radiative transfer calculations have been carried out to model the spectral energy distribution, given in the range of 0.5\textendash 25 \textmu m, and our 2.13 \textmu m visibility function, assuming spherical symmetry of the dust shell. Both can be fitted with a model containing double-sized grains (``small'' and ``large'') with the radii of a = 0.05 \textmu m and 0.38 \textmu m, and a mass fraction of the large grains greater than 65\%. Alternatively, a good match can be obtained with the grain size distribution function n(a) {$\sim$} a-3, with a ranging between 0.005 \textmu m and 0.6 \textmu m. At the inner boundary of the modelled dust shell (angular diameter {$\Theta$}in = (17{$\pm$}1) mas), the temperature of the smallest grains and the dust shell density are 1750 K {$\pm$} 100 K and (1 {$\pm$} 0.2) \texttimes{} 10-19 g/cm3, respectively. The dust formation rate is found to be (1.3 {$\pm$} 0.5) \texttimes{} 10-7 M /yr, assuming Vwind = 1200 km s-1.},

Although the formation of circumstellar disks can be a natural result of the conservation of angular momentum in the parent cloud, theoretical studies instead show disk formation to be difficult from dense molecular cores magnetized to a realistic level, owing to efficient magnetic braking that transports a large fraction of the angular momentum away from the circumstellar region. We review recent progress in the formation and early evolution of disks around young stellar objects of both low-mass and high-mass, with an emphasis on mechanisms that may bridge the gap between observation and theory, including non-ideal MHD effects and asymmetric perturbations in the collapsing core (e.g., magnetic field misalignment and turbulence). We also address the associated processes of outflow launching and the formation of multiple systems, and discuss possible implications in properties of protoplanetary disks.},

  abstract = {We present results of new Chandra~High-Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) observations (2019 November\textendash December) of the massive Wolf\textendash Rayet binary WR~48a. Analysis of these high-quality data showed that the spectral lines in this massive binary are broadened (full width at half-maximum, FWHM ~=~1400~km s-1) and marginally blueshifted ({$\sim-$}100~km s-1). A direct modelling of these high-resolution spectra in the framework of the standard colliding stellar wind (CSW) picture provided a very good correspondence between the shape of the theoretical and observed spectra. Also, the theoretical line profiles are in most cases an acceptable representation of the observed ones. We applied the CSW model to the X-ray spectra of WR~48a~from previous observations: Chandra-HETG (2012 October) and XMM\textendash Newton~(2008 January). From this expanded analysis, we find that the observed X-ray emission from WR~48a~is variable on the long time-scale (years) and the same is valid for its intrinsic X-ray emission. This requires variable mass-loss rates over the binary orbital period. The X-ray absorption (in excess of that from the stellar winds in the binary) is variable as well. We note that lower intrinsic X-ray emission is accompanied by higher X-ray absorption. A qualitative explanation could be that the presence of clumpy and non-spherically symmetric stellar winds may play a role.},

This is done on the basis of new optical and near-infrared spectral observations and on data from various archives in the optical, radio and X-rays. The optical spectrum of WR~48a is acceptably well represented by a sum of two spectra: of a WR star of the WC8 type and of a WR star of the WN8h type. The strength of the interstellar absorption features in the optical spectra of WR~48a and the near-by stars D2-3 and D2-7 (both members of the open cluster Danks~2) indicates that WR~48a is located at a distance of~{$\sim$}4~kpc from us. WR~48a is very likely a thermal radio source and for such a case and smooth (no clumps) wind its radio emission suggests a relatively high mass-loss rate of this dusty WR star (\$\textbackslash dot\{M\} \textbackslash approx \textbackslash mbox\{a few\} \textbackslash times 10\^\{-4\}\$~M{$\odot~$}yr-1). Long time-scale (years) variability of WR~48a is established in the optical, radio and X-rays. Colliding stellar winds likely play a very important role in the physics of this object. However, some luminous blue variable like activity could not be excluded as well.},

Lacking good observational guidance, theoretical models have remained controversial. This review offers a basic description of the collapse of a massive molecular core and a critical discussion of the three competing concepts of massive star formation: {$\blacksquare$} monolithic collapse in isolated cores {$\blacksquare$} competitive accretion in a protocluster environment {$\blacksquare$} stellar collisions and mergers in very dense systems We also review the observed outflows, multiplicity, and clustering properties of massive stars, the upper initial mass function and the upper mass limit. We conclude that high-mass star formation is not merely a scaled-up version of low-mass star formation with higher accretion rates, but partly a mechanism of its own, primarily owing to the role of stellar mass and radiation pressure in controlling the dynamics.},

The models based on Mathis' composite grains or on Greenberg \& Li's core-mantle grains can also provide quite good fits of the extinction and the measured scattering parameters, but still require an excessive amount of carbon which results in too large a C/O ratio. The inhomogeneous grains essentially contribute to the extinction in practically the whole wavelength range of our extinction curves. As a rule, such grains have quite wide size distributions, centred at around 100 nm, although graphite grains are mainly of small sizes.},
